EPISTOLA VIII 139

⁸ MS. έᾶ ¹³ MS. deyrattati3 Ο. deyratiati

the MS. before fuistiS, which Ο. omits, is a mistake for σᾶ, i. e.
causa. This emendation restores the cursus, giving the planus,
‘cansa fuistis’. The meaning would be that the removal of the
Apostolic See to Avignon was an eclipse not so much of Rome as
of the Papacy itself (figured by the Sun, the greater light 3 cf. Mon.
iii. 4, ll. 10--21 3 Epist. v. 169-70; Epist. vi. 54-5).

¹ ‘Filii Ursi ’ was a regular Latin rendering of the name Orsini,
as appears from the Consulte Fioremine (quoted by Del Lungo in Dal
secolo e dal Poema di Dante, p. 469), and from the letters of Cola
di Rienzo and of Coluccio Salutati3 cf. Nicholas III's description
of himself in Ins. xix, 70 as ‘figliuol dell' Orsa ', he being a member
of the Orsini family. The member of the family here addressed
by Dante was the Ghibelline Napoleone degli 'Orsini del Monte
(d. 1342), who had been created a Cardinal by Nicholas IV in 1288.
On the death of Boniface VIII in 1303 Napoleone (who, it must be

. borne in mind, in spite of his name, did not belong to the Orsini

faction), together with the Cardinal Niccolo da Prat0‚ as leaders of
the Colonna faction, took an active part, as villani records (viii. 80),
in securing the election of the French Pope Clement V in opposi-
tion to the Gaetani and Orsini fannon, one of the motives being to
secure the restoration of the two Golonna Cardinals, Jacopo and
Pietro, who had been deprived by Boniface VIII, a matter about
which he had since become lukewarm‚ as appears from Dante’s
reproaches in this passage. After his bitter experience of the
disastrous effects of Clement V's policy, as he himself acknowledges
in a letter to Philip the Fair (quoted by Witte), Napoleone was
now, in the Conclave at Carpentras, the leader of the opposition
to the Gaseon party—‘ capo di quella setta contro a’ Guaseoni’,
says villani (ix. 81)—in the hope of securing the election of an
Italian (or pro-Italian) Cardinal (see above, p. 124).

² It seems probable that deyradati, not deqratiati, as in 0., is the
correct emendation of the MS. deqrattati. Disyratia and disqratiatus
are registered by Du Gange, but I can find no instance of deqratiatus.
On the other hand, degradare and deyradatio (‘poena ecelesiastica,
qua quis suo gradu privatur') are recognized terms, and eminently
applicable to the case in point, namely degradation from the
cardinalate.
