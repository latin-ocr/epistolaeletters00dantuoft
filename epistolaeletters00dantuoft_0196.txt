⁴ The Prelate here referred to is supposed to be Gherardino
da Filattiera, a member of the Malaspina family, of the Spino
Fiorito branch, who was Bishop of Luni from 1312 to 1321. He
was an ardent GueH', and having refused to submit to the Emperor
Henry VII, and to take part in his coronation at Milan, was
deprived of his temporal power3. this, however, after the death
of the Emperor he in part recovered by the aid of Castruccio
Castracani, whom he nominated viscount of the Bishopric of
Luni, J uly 4, 1314. For Dante's ironical exception of the Bishop
here from his condemnation of the Italian Ohurch dignitaries,
cf. the similar exceptions in I‘nf. xxi. 41 z ‘ fuor che Bonturo’ ; and
Ins. xxix. 125 : ‘ Trammene Stricca'.

Μοναῑία, an exposition of the Book of J ob in 35 books, his Homilies
on Ezekiel, and on the ,Gospels, and his Dialoyues in four books on
the lives and miracles of the Italian saints,

⁶ St. Ambrose‚ 334-397 ; author of many hymns, and of exegetical
works on the Psalms and Gospel of St. Luke.

⁷ St. Augustine, 354-430; his two most famous books are the
Confessiones and De civitate Dei, besides which Dante quotes his
De Doctrina christiana (cf. Mon. iii. 4, ll. 60-72) and De Quantitate

nimae (cf. Epist. x. 556. and note).
