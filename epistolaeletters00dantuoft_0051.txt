specimen printed the first few paragraphs of the letter to
the Cardinals in an Appendix.1

Besides the letters of Dante and of Frate Ilario this
Laurentian MS. contains the poetical correspondence of
Dante and Griovanni del Virgilio. It has recently been
established by Henri Hauvette that these portions of the
Ms. are in the handwriting of Boccaccio,2 wh0‚ as we
have already stated, made use in his Vita di Dante of the
letter to a Florentine friend, and also, it may here be
added, of the letter of Frate Ilario in the same work.

In 1827, the year following Troya’s announcement of
his discovery in the Laurentian MS„ appeared the first
attempt at a collected edition of the letters of Dante.
This was Karl Witte's Dantis Alliyheriz' Epistolae quae
exstant, which was printed privately‚ in sixty copies only,3
at Padua in that year. The contents of this volume, the
idea of which seems to have been suggested to Witte by
the desire for such an edition expressed nearly a hundred
years before by Fontanini in his Eloquenza Italiam} were
as follows, there being seven letters in all ε

1. The Latin text of the letter to Cino da Pistoja
(Epist. iii (iv))‚ now printed for the first time from a copy
supplied by Sebastiano Giampi from the Laurentian MS.

2. The Italian translation of the letter to the Princes
and Peoples of Italy (Ffflst. v), first printed by Lazzari at
, Rome in 1754.

⁸ ‘In nur 60 verschenkten Exemplaren‚' wrote Witte of this
volume in his article Neu ausqefundene Briese des Dante Alliyhieri‚
published in 1838 in Bldtterficr literarische Unterhaltunq (Nos. 149-51),
and reprinted in Dante-Forschunqen‚ vol. i, pp. 473-87.

ederentur [Dantis Epistolae]‚ iam Fontaninus (Eloqu. ital. Ven.
1737, p. 154) desideravit)
