INTRODUCTION q xlvii

In 1837, ten years after the appearance of Witte’s
volume, occurred what is undoubtedly the most important
event yet recorded in the history of the letters of Dante ;
namely, the discovery in the Vatican Library‚ by a German
student named Theodor Heyse, while collating MSS. of
the Divina Commedia on behalf of Witte, of a fourteenth-
century MS. containing no less'than nine letters directly
or indirectly attributed to Dante.‘ The history of this
MS. ‚which, besides the letters of Dante,contains Petrarch’s
twelve eclogues and Dante's De Monarchia‚1 so far as
it has been possible to trace it, is briefly' as follows. It
was executed in the fourteenth century,2 apparently for
Francesco da MontepulcianO, of the family of the
Piendibeni of that place,3 a Tuscan notary of some dis-
tinction, the friend and correspondent of Coluccio Salu-
tati, the Florentine Chancellor, and successor of Filippo
Villani in the Chaneellorship of Perugia, who at the end
of the Eclogues has written his name and the date,

⁴ Perugia, 20 July, 1394.4 Francesco da Montepulciano

left his books to the Capitular Library of the Cathedral of
Montepulciano, the greater part of which was destroyed

¹ This was one of the MSS. which was utilized by Witte in his ·
edition of the treatise published at Vienna in 1874 (see p. lviii).

² Ο, Zenatti was of opinion that the original compiler of the
collection contained in this MS. was Boccaccio (see his Dante
e Firenze, pp. 458 ff. ; see also Buzzettino della Societcz Dantesca Italiam,
N .S. x. 139).
