INTRODUCTION xxix

'I'he ⁴ many letters ⁹ with which Bruni credits Dante, in
Filelfo's account become ‘letters innumerable ’, among
which heproceeds to specify three in particular, now

Filelfo's editor, Domenico Moreni‚ and by Pelli, Balbo,
and others, it would have made a most interesting and
valuable addition to our scanty information on the subject.
Unfortunately, however, Filelfo is a writer whose un-
