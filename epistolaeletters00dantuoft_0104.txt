EPISTOLA V

(‘ Ecce nunc tempus acceptabile’)

To THE Primores ΛΝΒ PEoPLEs oF ITALY

[Sept. or Oet. 1310]

MSS. —The Latin text of this letter (which was first known in
an early Italian translation‚¹ formerly attributed to Marsilio
Ficino) has been preserved in two MSS„ both of the fourteenth
century ε namely, the Vatican MS. (Cod. Vat.—Palat. Lat. 1729)
already mentioned, in which it occurs last of the nine letters
attributed to Dante in the MS.,2 and in which the text is in
several places defective ; and Cod. S. Pantaleo Sin the Biblioteca
Vittorio Emanuele at Rome, which contains also the Latin text,
and an Italian translation, of Dante's letter to the Emperor
Henry VII (Epist. vii).3 These two texts are independent, as is
evidentfrom the fact that the hiatus in the Vatioan MS. do
not occur in the other.

3 See Barbi, iu Bull. Soc. Dant. Ital„ ΝΕ. ii. 23. The MS. prob-
ably belongs to the latter half of the fourteenth century. Colomb
de Batines, who describes it in his Biblioyrafia Dantesca (ii. 208-9),
a'ssigns it to the first half of the fifteenth century. Besides the
letters of Dante above mentioned, this MS„ which belonged at one
time to Celso Gittadini (1555-1627), contains the text of the Divina
Commedia, lyrical poems of Dante and of Guido Caval'canti, and
other matter (see De Batines, loc. cia).
