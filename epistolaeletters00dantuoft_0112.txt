50 LETTERS OF DANTE

40 Huius iudicium omnem severitatem abhorret, et semper

Romani Imperii de fonte nascitur pietatis'. Petrarch, addressing
the Virgin in his Ganz. xlix (‘Vergine bella')‚ says (l. 43), ‘Tu
partoristi il fonte di· pietate ’. (See my Dante studies ancl Researches,
pp. 297-8.) The ultimate source of this saying has been traced to
the Actus Beati Silvestri by ΜΓ. F. E. Brightman‚ who has kindly
contributed the following note ε ‘ These Actus (which were printed
at Milan about 1480 in the Sami-uarium of Mombritius and were
reprinted by the Benedictines of Solesmes at Paris in 1910) are -
mentioned in the pseudo-Gelasian index of libri recipiendi, and were
one of the sources of the Donation of Constantine. They were read
for the matins Lessons of the feast of St. Silvester (Dec. 31), and
were therefore included in the PassionaZe or Leyencla Sanctorum.
But as they are of considerable length, when the Breviarium was
compssed, so as to include the whole Divine Service for the year in
a single volume, they, like the other legends, had to be curtailed.
But, at the same time, the complete Passionale continued to be
copied, and presumably to be used in some churches. Thus, of
four copies in the Bodleian, one is of Cent. xiii, two of Cent. xiv,
and one of Oent. xv. It is quite possible, therefore, that Dante
may have known the legend of St. Silvester either from a Passionale,
or from a Breviary which retained the passage in question—quite
apart from the Leyemza Aurea) The following is the passage as
given in the Cent. xiii Bodleian MS. (Canon. Misc. 230) of the
Passionale, which was written in 1204 by one Matthew the Floren-
tine: ‘Constantinus Augustus monarchiam tenens, cum plurimas
strages de christianis dedisset, et innumerabilem populum per ξ
omnes provincias fecisset variis poenarum generibus interfici,
elefantiae a Deo lepra in toto corpore percussus est. Huic cum
diversa magorum et medicorum agmina subvenire non potuissent,
pontifices Capitolii hoc dederunt consilium: debere piscinam fieri
in ipso Capitolio quae puerorum sanguine repleretur. In quam
calido ac fumante sanguine nudus descendens Augustus, mox
posset vulnere illius leprae mundari. Iussum est igitur et de
rebus fisci vel patrimonii regis ad tria millia et eo amplius infantes
adduci ad urbem Romam. Pontificibus traditi sunt Capitolii.
Die autem constituto egrediente imperatore Constantino palatium
ad hoc eunte ad Capitolium ut sanguis innoxius funderetur,
occurrit multitudo mulierum quae omnes resolutis crinibus, nuda-
tisque pectoribus, dantes ululatus et mugitus coram eo se in
