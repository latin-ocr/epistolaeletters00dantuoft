xxxvi LE'H'ERS OF DANTE

in Torrist Fraticelli,2 and Scheffer·Boichorst,³ among others

Ι of more recent date.

A few years after the publication of Doni’s Prosc we
hear from several quarters of the letter to Can Grande
(Epist. x), which, as has already been mentioned, was
utilized by several of the early commentators on the
Commodia, though, with the exception of Filippo Villani,
they make no reference to it by name.4 Giovan Batista
Gelli, best known as the author of I Capriccz' del Bottaio
(Englished not long after his death as The Fearfall Fansies
of the Florentine Coma-er), who delivered a series of public
lectures on Dante before the Florentino Academy at
various times between 1541 and 1563, in a discussion
in his eighth course, in 1562, as to the title Commedz’a
bestowed by Dante on his poem, recapitulates what he
had said on the subject in a previous lecture, and then
proceeds as follows:

All that I told you on the former occasion as the
expression of my own personal opinion, I to-day repeat to
you as a matter of my own knowledge. For a year or two
ago there came into my hands, through the good offices of
the deceased Tommaso Santini, a fellow citizen of ours, γ
a letter in Latin, which our Poet sent to the Lord Gan
Grande della Scala, Vicar·General of the principality of
Verona and of Vicenza‚ together with a presentation *copy
of the third cantica of his poem, namely the Paradiso.

1 See his Epistole di Dante Alliyhierz· edite e incolite, pp. xvii—xviii, 71.
² See his Opere minori di Dante, vol. iii, pp. 47 6 ff. After examining

¹ the arguments on both sides, Fraticelli says : ‘Io non affermero che

la lettera appartenga indubbiamente al nostro Alighieri ; ma posti
in bilancia gli argomenti che dall' una e dall' altra parte si
adducono, parmi che preponderino quelli che stanno per 1’ affer-
mativa.'
