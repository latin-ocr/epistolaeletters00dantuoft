of Hosts, in whose sight thou strivest ; and overthrow this
Goliath with the sling of thy wisdom and with the stone

shall fiee and Israel shall be delivered. Then our heritage
which was taken away, and for which we lament without
ceasing‚ shall be restored to us whole againD‘ But even as
now, remembering the most holy Jerusalem, we moui-n
as exiles in Babylon, so then as citizenS‚ and breathing in
peace, we shall think with joy on the miseries of Con-
fusion.
