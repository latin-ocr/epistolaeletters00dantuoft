EPISTOLA VIII 147

§1- There will be amendment, however (although it
cannot-‚be but thala the soar of infamy will disfigure with
its mark the Apostolio See even until the fire for which
the heavens ‘chat 'now are and the earth have been
reserved), if you all, who were the authors of this devia-
tion from the firaok, with one accord shall fight mansully
for the Spouse of christ, for the seat of sshe Spouse‚ which
is Rome, for our Italy, and, to speak more at large, for
the whole body politic now in pilgrimage on earth, sothai:
from the wrestling-ground (surveyed on every side from
the shores of ocean) of the contest that is already begun,
offering yourselves with glory, you may be able to hear
‘ Glory in the highest ⁹, and that the reproaoh of the
GasconS‚ who, burning with abominable lust, strive to
usurp for themselves the glory of the It 'ans, may be an
example to posterity for all ages to come. ³
