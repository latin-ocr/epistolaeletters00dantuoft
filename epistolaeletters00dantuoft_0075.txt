EPISTOLA 11 '13

accounts of this attempt¹ no mention is made of Alessandro,
who, as captain of the league‚ should naturally have headed
the expedition3 whence it has been assumed that he died
before that date. Further, if the writer of the letter was Dante,
it follows that it must have been written before the same date,
since the writer speaks of the death of Alessandro as having
been a cruel blow to the hopes of th'e exiles, and to himself
among them, who placed in Alessandro his hopes of a return
to Florence (11. 20-6); thus showing that the writer was in
association with the exiles at the date of the letter, whereas

Dante almost certainly had finally dissociated himself from ¹
the exiles before the attempt from Lastra of July 20.2 The
letter, then, if written by Dante, may be assigned with every
appearance of probability to the spring or early summer

of 1304.

SUMMARY.—§ 1. The writer declares his devotion for the
deceased, whose memory he will ever chel-ish3 recalls his
virtues, showing how his character was in keeping with the
device on his escutcheon; and deplores his death as a heavy
blow 130 the hopes of his party, the writer included, who had
looked to him to restore their fortunes. §2 Yet consolation
is to be found in the thought that his virtues have gained him
a place of honour in the heavenly Jerusalem ; wherefore those
who now enter upon his earthly heritage are urged not to
grieve for his loss overmuch, but to seek‚ as his heirs‚ to follow
in his footstepS. ξ 3. Ι11 conclusion, the writer craves to be
excused for his absence from the funeral rites, on the score
of the poverty brought upon him by exile, which has deprived
him of the means of making a fitting appearance on the
occasmn.
