noble than the other, or vice versa, as I have known

before now. Ι 310 returning to Ravenna and shall not

you to say to this‘? '³ And I wrote back to Dante . . .'

(Ma qui me scrisse dubitando Dante:
Son doi figlioli nati in uno parto,
E piu gentil si mostra quel davante‚
Et cio converso, come gia vedi.
Torno a Ravenna, e de 11 000 101 parto.
Dime‚ Esculano, quel che tu credi.
Rescrissi a Dante: Intendi tu che leggi . . .)

j · This correspondence with 06660 d’Ascoli must have
⁷ taken place during the last three or four years of Dante’s
life, while he was the guest of Guido Novello da Polenta
·' at Ravenna, that is, probably, not earlier than 1317.
t Villani’s testimony is contained in the ninth book of
Ξ 1115 Orom‘ca, a chapter of which, under the year 1321, the
2⁸ year of Dante's death, is devoted to a brief biographical
{s account of his distinguished fellow-citizen (ix. 136: ‘ Chi
J fu il poeta Dante Alighieri di Firenze ’). In this account,
in which he gives an enumeration of Dante's most im-
9 portant writings, after mentioning the Vita Nzwva and

the canzoni, Villani says:

This Dante, when he was in exile, wrote, among others,
three noble letters, one of which he sent to the govern-
ment of Florence‚ complaining of his undeserved exile;
the second he sent to the Emperor Henry when he was

Δ besieging Β1·65613,1 reproaching him for his delay, after
the manner of the prophets of old; and the third he
³ 'sent to 1116 Italian Cardinals at the time of the vacancy
of the Holy See after the death of Pope Clement‚ urging
them to agree together in electing an Italian Pope.
