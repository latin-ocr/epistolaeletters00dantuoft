printed trial texts of Epist. vii and ix),1 is still awaited,

another on 12' Epistola dt Dante a Moroello Malaspina in Dante e la Luni-
9iana, Milano, 1909 (pp. 507-42).

Volqata, con Introduzioni e Note, per cura di Ermenegildo Pistelli,

² The foregoing Introduction, being concerned mainly with the
history of the text of the letters, contains no mention (save inciden-
tassy) of translations and critical essays. As regards translations—

Italian versions are included in the editions of the letters published
by Fraticelli (Firenze, 1840, 1857, azo.) and by 'Porri (Livorno, 1842) ;

there is a German translation by Kannegiesser (Leipzig, 1845); ’

and there are two English translations, one by the late G. S. Latham
(Dante's Eteven Letters, Boston, 1891), the other by P. H. Wicksteed
(in Translation qs the Latin Worlcs os Dante, London, 1894). Further
details as to these and other translations are given in the intro-
ductory notes prefixed to each letter in the body of the work.
OrItical essays are numerous ; deserving of special mention here are
the article by the late A. Della Torre on ‘L'Epistola all' Amico
Fiorentino ', in Bullettino detta Societa Dantesca Italiam, N .S., xii.
121-743 that by the late F. Novati in the volume Lectum Dantis .-
Le Opere Minori di Dante Aliyhieri (Firenze, 1906) 3 and two by the late
Dr. Edward Moore, on ‘The Epistle to Can Grande’ (in studies in
Dante. Third Series. Oxford, 1903), and on ‘The Battifolle Letters ³
(in Stadios in Dante. Fourth Series. Oxford, 1917). References to
many other articles of importance will be found in the admirable
indices to the volumes of the Bullettino della Societa Dantesca Italiam,

edited originally by M. Barbi, and latterly by Ε. G. Parodi.

*ac* Since the above Introduction was written (1916) another text ⁴

of the Epistolae has been published, viz. that contained in the edition
of Dante’s Latin prose works issued at Florence in 1917 by
G. Barbera (see below, p. 2, n. 1). This text, which, as is aoknow-
ledged in the Avvertenza prefixed to the volume, is largely based
upon the texts printed by me in the Modern Lanqaaye Review, is
reproduced without alteration in the edition of Tatte le opere di Dante
issued by the same firm two years later.
