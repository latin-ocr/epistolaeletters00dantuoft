xxxviii LETTERS OF DANTE

The Can Grande letter was known also to sundry other
writers on Dante in the sixteenth century, contemporaries
of Gelli (1498-1563), among others to Lodovico Castel-
vetro (1505-71) of Modena, Vincenzo Borghini (1515-80) ¹
of Florence, and Jacopo Mazzoni (1548-98) of Cesena.1
Castelvetro in his Sposizione di eamq: ventinove dell’ Inferno
di Dante (first published in 1886) identifies the ‘Veltro'
of Inserno i. 101 with Can Grande, to whom, he sayS,
according to Boccaccio in his life of Dante, the poet dedi-
cated the Commodia3 ‘hutz he continues, ‘I have in my
⁸ possession a Ms. of a letter of Dante's, written in Latin,
which begins “Dantes Aligerius natione florentinus, non
moribus, magno Cani etc.''; from which letter it clearly
appears that Dante dedicated to Can Grande, not the whole
poem, but the Paradiso only ’.2 It should be noted that
Castelvetro here misrepresents Boccaccio, who does not
assert positively that Dante dedicated the Commedia as a
whole to Gan Grande, but states that opinions differed as
to the dedication, inasmuch as, according to some, Dante
dedicated the Inferno 10 Uguccione della Faggiuola, the ,
Paryatorio to Moroello Malaspina, and the Paradiso to
Frederick the Third of Sicily3 While, according to others,
he dedicated the whole poem to Can Grande.3 Castelvetro
quotes the title of the letter again, in his comment on
Inferwo xv. 69, as a proof that Dante obeyed Brunetto
Latini's injunction to dissociate himself from the evil
