xxii LETTERS OF DANTE

tells us that after his own exile Dante, in order to obtain
his recall, wrote many letters to individual members of
the Florentine Government‚ as well as to the people
of Florence (‘ scrisse piu volte non solamente a’ particulari
cittadini del reggimentO, ma ancora al popolo ⁵), among
the rest one of some length, beginning ‘Popule mee, quid
feci tibi‘?'—a sentence which in a till recently unre-
corded version of Bruni’s Vital is amplified by the com-
pletion of the quotation from Micah vi. 3, into ‘Popule
mee, quid feci tibi? aut in quo molestatus [for molestus]
fui responde mihi ’. When, however, continues Bruni,
the Emperor Henry VII crossed the Alps, Dante changed -
his tone, and began to write in abusive terms to the
FlorentineS, calling them ‘scellerati e cattivi’, and>
threatening them with the vengeance of the Emperor,
against whose might all resistance would be vain. But
when the Emperor, whose advance against Florence had
been urged by Dante (an obvious allusion to Dante’s
letter to the Emperor), actually made his appearance
under its walls, Dante in a further letter expressed his
intention on patriotic grounds of not personally assisting
at the siege of his native city.2 Finally Bruni refers to
a letter (which may or may not be identical with the

mori) Dante’s term of office expired on August 15, 13003 Guido
Cavalcanti was buried at Florence on August 29 ; so that his death
must have taken place within a few days of his return from
exile.

of the Vita di Dante of Leonardo Bruni '‚ in T wenty-Ninth Annuaz Report
(1912) of the Cambridye (U.S.A.) Dante Society.

² Dante makes no such persona] reference in the letters to
Henry VII and to the Florentines which have come down to us;
Bruni must therefore be referring to another letter, addressed
either to the Emperor or to the Florentines.
