EPISTOLA VII 83

’,ν teenth-century MSS. (Vatican and S. Pantaleo), are in agree-

 

ment, as against M. (the Marcian MS.)‚ in 75 instances ¹ 3 while
P. and M. are in agreement, as against V., in 25 instances²;
and V. and M.‚ as against P„ in 18 instances.3 A strong link
between P. and M.‚ as against V., is the fact that these two con-
tain both title and colophon of the letter (though not in entirely
identical terms), which are omitted in V. On the other hand,
M. omits a passa-ge of several lines (11. 152-4 in the Oxford text)
which is found in both V. ancl P., and contains a large number
of blunders ‘¹ which are absent from the other two. A considera-
tion of the data seems to warrant the conclusion that the
relationship between V. and P. is on the whole closer than that
of either of them to ΜΡ

that the MS. containing the letter was discovered, and placed at
Witte⁹s disposal for the purposes of his projected edition of Dante’s

⁶ Parodi, however, as it seems to me on insufficient data, thinks
that P. and M. belong to the same family (see Buzl. Soc. Dant. Ital„
N .S. xiX. 2533 xxii. 140). Ρ. Wagner, on the other hand, places V.
and M. in one group, and P. in another (see Die Echtheit der ἄνεί
Kaiserbriefe Dantes, Koln, 1907, p. 11).
