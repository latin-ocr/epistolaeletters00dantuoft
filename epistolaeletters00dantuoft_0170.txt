style, phraseology‚ and thoughts, and especially of indirect-
Virgilian quotations and reminiscences imbedded in the letters,

DA'rE.—These three letters were probably all written in the
spring of 1311—the first perhaps towards the end of April,
after the Emperor had set out from Milan (April 19) in order
to reduce Cremona and the other rebellious cities of Lombardy ;
the second at the end of April or beginning of May, during the
operations against Cremona ; and the third (dated May 18) after
the reduction of Cremona.²

SUMMARY.—The Countess returns humble thanks for the
> condescension of the Empress in writing to send news of the
well-being of the Emperor and of herself ; and prays that God
may grant success to the Emperor in his endeavours to restore
peace and order.
