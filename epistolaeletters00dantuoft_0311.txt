'THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE S. PANTALEO
ITALIAN TRANSLATION or EPIST. v11 AND
· THE s. PANTALEO LATIN ΤΕΧΤ.1

There exist two early Italian translations of Dante’s
letter to the Emperor Henry VII (Epist. vii). The first,
which was undoubtedly executed in the fourteenth century,
has, so far as is known, been preserved in one MS. only
(of Cent. xiv), namely Ood. S. Pantalco 8 in the Biblioteca
Vittorio Emanuele at Rome. This translation was first
printed in the Modern Lanyaayc Revicw, vol. ix, pp. 335—
43. The second, which at one time was attributed to
Marsilio Ficino (1433—99), but which probably dates
from towards the end of the fourteenth century, has been
preserved in at least ten MSS. (two of which have been
assigned to Cent. xiv, while the remainder belong to
Oent. ΧΥ),2 and has many times been printed.³

That these two translations are the work of different
hands, a comparison of the text of the former with the
renderings of the later version (where they differ), as
