. EPISTOLA IV (III) 41

As others bid, where they must fall as dead.
When Ι draw near, a voice mine ears doth fill,
Which saith: Away! seek'st thou his death to see ⁶?
Then look I out, and search to whom to flee
For succourz-to this pass I now am led
By those bright eyes that baleful lustre shed.
What I become when smitten thus, Ο Love,
Thou can'st relate, not I;
For thou dost stay to look while Ι lie dead,
And if my soul back to .my heart should move,
Blind loss of memory
Hath been with her while she from earth hath fied.
When I rise up, and see the wound that bled,
And cast me down sore smitten by the blow‚ f
No comfort can I know
Το keep me from the shuddering thrill of fear3
And then my looks, with pallor o’er them spread,
Show what that lightning was that laid me low.
For, grant it came with sweet smile all aglow,
Long time all clouded doth my face appear,
Because my spirit gains no safety clear.
Thus thou hast brought me, Love, to Alpine vale,
Where flows the river bright,
Along whose banks thou still o’er me dost reign.
Alive or dead thou dost at will assail,
Thanks to the* fierce keen light
Which flashing opes the way for Death's campaign.
Alas! for ladies fair I look in vain,
Or kindly men, to pity my deep woe.
If she unheeding go,
Ι have no hope that others help will send,
And she, no longer bound to thy domam,
Cares not, Ο Sire, for dart that thou dost throw;
Such shield of pride around her breast doth go,
That every dart thereon its course doth end;
And thus her heart against them doth defend.
Dear mountain song of mine, thou goest thy way,
Perchance thou'lt Florence see, mine own dear land,
That drives me doomed and banned,
Showing no pity, and devoid of love.
If thou dost enter there, pass on, and say,
‘My Lorcl no more against you can wage war,
There, whence Ι come, his chains so heavy are,
That, though thy fierce wrath placable should prove,
No longer freedom hath he thence to move '.]¹
