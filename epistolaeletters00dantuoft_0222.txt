EPISTOLA X

(ζ Inclyta vestrae Magnfficentiae laus’)

To CAN GRANDE DELLA Sem.

[ο. 1319]

MSS—This letter has be‘en preserved, in whole or in part, in
six MS. texts, two of Ceut. xv, which contain the first four
sections only (that is, the strictly epistolary portion) of the
letter, namely, Cod. Ambrosiano 0. 145. Inf. at Milan (A.)‚ and
Cod. Lat. 78 at Munich (M.) 1; and four of Cent. xvi, three of
which contain the whole letter, namely, Cod. Mediceo (forming
part of the Garbe Strozziane) in the Archivio di Stato at Florence
(Me.)‚ Cod. Mayliabechiano vi. 164 at Florence (M.1)‚ and God.
314 in the Capitular Library at Verona (V.)‚ while the fourth
(M.2)‚ which is preserved in the same Cod. Maqliabechiano which
contains the complete text, is incomplete, sections 4-6, and
28-32 inclusive, being wanting.2

¹ The preamble (‘Praefari aliqua ’)‚ which is prefixed to the
letter in the other four MSS„ is also wanting in these two MSS.
(see Introduction (p. xli-ii).

2 For the above account of the MSS. containing the letter I am
indebted to the exhaustive article of G. Boffito published in 1907
in the Transactions of the Reale Accademia delle Scienze of 'Purin
(L’ Epistola di Dante Aliyhieri α Ganyrande della Scala .· Sayyio d’ Edizione
critica e di commento, p. 2). Owing to the fact that, in spite of
repeated efforts on his own and on my behalf by the late Dr. Moore,
it proved impossible to procuro photographic reproductions of these
MSS„ I have been unable to make diplomatic transcripts of the
MS. texts as in the case of previous letters, and have been obliged
to rely upon the collatioris of the MSS. printed by Boffito in the
above-mentioned article. A tentative sketch of the relationship
of the six MSS. was published by Vincenzo Biagi in a review (to
which I am much indebted) of Boffito’s article in Bullettino della
Sociot& Dantesca Italiana, NS. xvi. 21-37 (1909). In this scheme
