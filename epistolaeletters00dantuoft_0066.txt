4 LETTERS OF DANTE

parture from Florence at the beginning of June ¹, after his
failure to effect a pacification ².

SUMMARY.—§ 1. The exiles acknowledge receipt of a letter
from the Cardinal, and crave indulgence for their delay in
replying to it, on the ground that the matters in question
required careful consideration, and necessitated frequent con-
sultation with other members of the league. ξ 2. They express
their gratification at his promise to restore peace to Florence,
which, they protest, was the sole object of their own recourse
to arms3 and declare that no words of theirs would be adequate
to convey their thanks for so great a service to themselves and
to Florence. ξ 3. They, further, acknowledge a communication
by word of mouth from 3, messenger despatched to them by the
Cardinal, charging them (as did his letter) to abstain from all
acts of warfare, and to submit themselves unreservedly to his
discretion; which they pledge themselves to clo, as his messenger -
will inform him, and as they will cause to be published abroad
in due form. ξ 4. In conclusion they pray that he may restore
peace to Florence, and implore his protection for themselves
and their coadjutors, finally pledging themselves once more to
render strict obedience to his behestS.

1 Dino Compagni (iii. 7) gives June 9 as the date of his de·
parture 3 Villani (viii. 69) says June 4.

2 Del Lungo, who does not impugn the authenticity of the letter
as a genuine document, holds (loc. cit.) that it was written subse-
quently to the exiles’ abortive attempt from Lastra to force an
entry into Florence on J uly 203 and that consequently the writer
could not have been Dante, who by that time, as seems to be
certain, had separated himself from ‘la compagnia malvagia
e scempia' (Par. xvi. 62) of his follow-exiles. But the arguments
adduced in support of this contentiori are not convincing.
