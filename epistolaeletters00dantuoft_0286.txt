DANTE ΛΝΒ THE CURSUS

ξ 1. HISTORY AND NATURE1⁰F THE MEDIAEVAL
GURSUS

The cursus is the name given to the harmonious
arrangement, according to prescribed laws, of the words
at the end of the clause or sentence in prose composition
—‘artifioiosa dictionum structura ', as it is defined by a
thirteenth-century writer on the subject.² The mediaeval
cursus may be described as the lineal descendant of the
classica] cursus, with the substitution of accent for
quantity; that is to say, mediaeval Latin prose, when
written in accordance with the laws of the cursus, was
accentual or rhythmical, instead of being metrical, like
the ‘prosa numerosa ' of Cicero.

During the period of transition, which apparently be-
gan in the latter half of the fourth century, and is usually
reckoned to close with Gregory the Great (540-604)‚
before the stress of the accent had altogether obliterated
the recognition of quantity, there prevailed a style which
was characterized by a mixture of the two—cursus mixtus,
as it has been called—some of the clausulae being metri-

Lanyuaqe Review (xiii. 420 ff.>‚ I am largely indebted to the paper
on The Cursus in Mediaeval and Vuzqar Latin by Professor A. C. Clark
(Oxford, 1910); to the secondedition of Il Cursus ‘nella Storia
Letteraria e nella Lituryia of Angelo De Santi (Rome, 1903); and
to chapter iv of R. L. Poole's Lectures on the History of the Papaz
chancery (Cambridge, 1915).

his Histoire des Doctrines yrammaticales au Moyen Aye (in Notices et

artificiosa dictionum structura, ideo a quibusdam cursus vocatur,
quia, cum artificialiter dictiones locantur, currere sonitu delectabili
per aures videntur cum beneplacito auditommJ
