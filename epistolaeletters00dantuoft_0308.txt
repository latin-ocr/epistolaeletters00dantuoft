246 LETTERS OF DANTE

The requirements of the cursus doubtless also account for
Dante’s use in the Epistolae of the names ‘Naso' and
‘ Maro ' instead of ‘Ovidius ’ and ‘Virgilius ’3 as in Epist.
iii (iv). 40: ‘Auctoritatem vero Nasonis' ¹ (χοῦς and
Epist. vii. 23-4 ε ⁴ Virginem redeuntem cum Marone canta-
bant' (pl); as well as of ‘Latialis’ instead of ‘Italicus'
'in at least one passage where it occurs, viz. in Epist.
v. 100: ‘incolae Latiales'2 (v).

IRREGULAR CLAUSULAE.

Among clausulae in the Epistolae which do not conform

too anytr (ἕ the commonly accepted types the following may
e no e ε

i. (ὠ ev Ι ὦ ev). Paroxytone dissyllable preceded by par-
oxytone dissyllable (or polysyllable)‚ the caesura fall-
ing after the second syllable of the clausula. Of this
type 1 have noted six instances‚ viz. ⁴(in lumine radi)-
orum eius ’ (v. 14-15) ; ⁴(qui bibitis flu)enta eius' (v. 105) ;
‘(oblivis)catur sui' (vi. 65); ‘(quia) caeci estis'3 (vi. 151-2) ;
‘(in) usu eius’ (vii. 4); and without caesura, ‘(humanae
appre)hensi6ni' (v. 123-4).

ii. (ώιντν Ι ὦ). Monosyllable preceded by proparoxytone
trisyllable (or its equivalent), the caesura falling after

the third syllable of the clausula. Of this type I have
noted the following three instances: ⁴(na)t1'1ra non vult ’

similar case of the use by Asiatic writers of παραπληρώματα, οι·
words ⁴ numero inservientia ', which is referred to by Cicero in the
Orator, ξ 69: ‘Apud alios autem, et Asiaticos maxime, numero
servientes, inculcata reperias inania quaedam verba, quasi comple-
menta numerorum '. There can be no doubt, says Professor Clark,
that the Latins frequently chose words which gave the desired
rhythm, even if they were otiose, or if they were not the most
appropriate to convey the particular nuance of sense suitable to the
context.

1 Dante no doubt could have written ‘vero Ovidii ’ (t), and still
have observed the cursus, but he avoided the cacophony by the
substitution of ‘Nasonisfi
ί 2 The printed texts read ‘Italiae '‚ but the MS. reading is

Latiales'.

⁸ Parodi suggests (Buzz. Soc. Dant. Ital„ N.S. xix, 258) that

possibly the right reading is ‘quoniam caeci estis ' (velox).
