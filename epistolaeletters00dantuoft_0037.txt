INTRODUCTION xxxi

Such being the case, we have no alternative but to con-
clude, as most recent critics have done, that the letters
quoted as Dante’s by Filelfo are equally apocryphal. It
is not without significance in this connexion that Filelfo’s
best known work, of which no less than eight editions
were printed in the fifteenth century, was an Epistolarium,

seu de arte conficiendi epistolas opus ; ¹ so that no doubt in
his ‘confection' of these alleged letters of Dante he was
but' exercising himself in an art of which he was the
professed exponent.

With Filelfo we take leave of the early biographers of
v Dante, subsequent notices, such as those of Landino and
Vellutello,2 containing nothing, so far as Dante's letters

‘the eighty possible categories under which epistles can fall '. An
example of each of these categories is given, and to each of them is

’ ‘sinonima gratulatoria'‚ ‘sinonima postulativa’, ‘sinonima vitu-
peratoria’, ‘ sinonima invectiva '‚ and so on. The ‘ exemplum ’
under the last heading is ‘Es una omnium voce sentina scelerum
cloaca foetidissima l '

with Filelfo's life of Dante, of which he did not disdain to avail
Δ himself, though he severely criticizes the author on the score of his
numerous irrelevancies‚ and of his disbelief in the reality of
Beatrice ε ‘ Scrisse la vita di Dante dopo Γ Aretino, Mario Filelfo in
lingua latina, . . . introducendovi molte cose pin tosto impertinenti
