152 LETTERS OF DANTE

DATE.-The date of the letter is fixed approximately by
Dante’s reference to his having been in exile for nearly fifteen
years (⁴ per trilustrium fere perpessus exilium '‚ l. 29). The first
sentence of banishment issued by Caute de' Gabrielli, the then
Podesta, was dated Jan. 27, 1302; and the second was on
March 10 of the same year ; so that the terminus ad quem would
be the beginning of 1317. Until recently it was supposed that
the amnesty referred to in the letter was that of June 2, 1316.
But it has been shown by Barbi that all the exiles condemned
by Cante de' Gabrielli were expressly excluded from this am-
nesty‚ Dante consequently among them.l The amnesties of
Sept. 3 and Dec. 11, 1316, are equally out of the question, in
that they were not general amnesties‚ but only extended to
certain specified persons, among whom Dante was not included.²
It is concluded‚ therefore, that the amnesty in question in the
letter is that of May 19, 1315, in the terms of which Dante
would be implicitly included.3 The letter, then, was probably
written towards the end of May, 1315}

ADDRESSEE.——It appears from 11. 13-14 of the letter that
Dante and his correspondent were relatives, as they had
a nephew in common; further, from the fact that Dante twice
addresses him as ‘Pater' (11. 22, 41), and speaks of having
received his letter ‘with due reverence’ (11. 1-2), 113 has been

via, 6116 alcuno che nel seno della filosofia allevato e cresciuto fosse,
clivenisse candelotto del suo comune ' (ed. Rostagno, ξ 22).

‘ribandimento ' of June 2, 1316, are quoted, among those excluded
being ‘omnes et singuli qui quacumque de causa per dominum
Cantem de Gabriellibus de Eugubio, olim potestatem Florentie, vel
eius vicarium, fuerunt condempnati et exbanniti seu condempnati
tantum aut exbanniti infra tempus infrascriptum, videlicet a
kallendis novembris sub anno Domini millesimo trecentesimo
primo usque ad kallendas Iulii tunc subsequentis sub anno Domini
millesimo trecentesimo secundo ’. ’
