250 LETTERS OF DANTE

given in the apparatus criticus of the above-mentioned
article, will prove almost beyond question.¹

The same MS. (Ood. S. Pantaleo 8) which contains the
earlier translation contains also, following immediately
after it, but transcribed by a different copyist, the Latin
text of the letter (a transcript of which was printed in
the Modern Lanyuaye Review, vol. vii, pp. 208—14).
How far this translation was made direct from the Latin
text in the same MS. (which is the earliest of the three
MSS. in which Epist. vii has been preserved), and how
far, consequently, it can be regarded as an independent
authority, is an interesting question. On the one hand,
there are several remarkable coincidences, three of them
involving the same blunder, which seem to point to
a close relation between the two. On the other hand,
there is the no less striking fact that in a large number of
instances the translation is markedly at variance with
the accompanying Latin text; from which it is evident
that the translator cannot have been dependent upon the
S. Pantaleo Latin text alone for his version, but must
have had before him some other textual authority. It
follows, therefore, that the Italian translation contained
in this MS„ which in one instance ² offers a more correct
reading than any of the extant MSS. of the Latin text,
has a certain independent value of its own, as representing
a text of the original which has since disappeared.

The chief coincidences between the Italian translation

and the Latin text in the S. Pantaleo MS. are the
following:

In the title, al yloriosissimo et felicissimo triunfactore ⁸ =
yleriosissimo atque felicissimo triumphatori (where the

¹ It will be noted at the same time that the earlier version is, as
a rule, far more correct than the later one. (See, however, paroch,
in Bull. Soc. Dant. Ital„ N.S. xxii. 138.)

² Namely in l. 56, where all three MSS. of the Latin text read
Auyustum‚ the translation has strectecqa, representing anwstum,
which is undoubtedly the correct reading.

3 Here the later translation is in agreement.
