1 Carta, 1. 57 : ‘quel tuono, che mi giunse addosso '. Gen. tonitrui
comes from the nom. tonitruum, a form which occurs frequently in
the Vulgate (eg. Job xxxviii. 25: ‘viam sonantis tonitrui' ;
Mark iii. 17: ‘Boanerges‚ quod est, Filii tonitrui '); cf. Giovanni
da Genova in the Catholicon: ‘hic tonitrus, -trus, . . . et hoc toni-
truum, tonitrui ’.

² Boccaccio, who incorporated this passage in the letter men-
tioned above (see p. 31), has divini33 the reading of the MS. is
quite clear—the meaning apparently is ‘ of everyday occurrence '‚
⁴ such as happen in our everyday experience '.

³ Canz„ ll. 22-5: ‘la riguarda, e . . . s’adira, Gh’ ha fatto il foco
ov’ella trista incende '.

⁴ Novati (op. cit, pp. 531-3) argues at some length that this
second occidit should be taken, not as from occido, as before, but as
from occido 3 and he explains : ‘ propositum occidit come sol occidit ⁹, in
which he is followed by Passerini, who renders ‘cadde cosi quel
laudabil proposito'. But this seems quite unnecessary; and,
moreover, it destroys the Dantesque symmetry of the whole
passage, besides involving a very awkward construction, necessi-
tating the change of subject from amor to propositum, and then back
again to amor. Occidit here is surely the same verb as in the
previous sentence. Dante says, Love ‘slew (occidit) or expelled
(expulit) or fettered (liyavit)' whatever was opposed to himself in
Dante ; and he then proceeds to give an instance of each of these
acts—Love slew (occidit), i. e. made an end of, Dante’s resolve to
keep aloof from women ; he banisl1ed(re1e9avit) Dante's meditations
on higher things ; and he fettered (ziqavit) Dante’s free will. (The
use of releqavit, instead of the repetition of expulit, as in the case
