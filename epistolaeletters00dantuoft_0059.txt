Societd Dantesca Italicma ⁵ to yet another MS„ the fourth,
containing letters of Dante. This was the fourteenth-
century San Pantaleo Ms. in the Biblioteca Vittorio
Emanuele at Rome,⁶ which had been registered by Colomb
de Batines in his Biblioyrafia Dantesca ⁷ fifty years before,
but had strangely been overlooked by all the editors of the
letters.

letters contained in this San Pantaleo Ms„ of the one in
the Venetian MS„ of the nine in the Vatican MS„ and of

ix, Χ, and the three Battifolle letters), have been printed in
