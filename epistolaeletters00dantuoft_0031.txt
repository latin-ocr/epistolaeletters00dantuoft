Oddone Zenatti, pp. 370-5 note, 414-19. In this work (pp. 418-19)
Zenatti contends that Manetti‘s unmistakable reference to the title
of Dante's letter to the Florentines is proof positive that he had
actually first-hand knowledge of the letter at the time when he
was writing his Vita Bautis-3 and he maintains, further, that
Bruni’s acquaintance with the letter cannot be regarded as certain

⁷ on account of the‘v‘hgueness of his reference: ‘Dalle vaghe parole

dell’ Aret-ino, malgrado dello seeum-ati, non e dato di trarre la
certezza, ch' egli abbia propriamente avuto sott’ occhio anche
l’ epistola ai Fiorentini ; con le sue ora citate, il Manetti ci da inveee
la prova piu sicura di aver Ietta quell' epistola, di averne con
precisione conosciuto il titolo (Scelestissimis) florentinis intrinsecis)
Torraca, in a review of Zenatti's volume in the Bulzettino della Societct
Dantesca Italiana (Ns. x. 121 ff.)‚ pointed out that if Manetti read

3 Dante’s letter, at any rate he did not read the date of it (namely,
j March 31, 1311), for he states that it was written at the time of the
siege of Florence by the Emperor, whereas, as a matter of fact, the

'ss siege was not begun until the autumn of the following year.

, Manetti's authority, however, as Ι have shown in the Modern

, Lanquaqe Review (xiv. 111-12), was not the letter itself, but the follow-

· ing passage in Bruni's Historiae Florentimte: ⁴ Herricus . . . superatis

j Alpibus, in citeriorem Galliam descendisse nunciabatur, et quid-

' quid ubique fuerat exulum Florentinorum, ad illum concurrisse,

adeo spe firma victoriae, ut iam inde bona inimicorum inter se
partirentur. Extat Dantis poetae epistola amarissimis referta con-

’ tumeliis, quam ipse hac inani fiducia exultans, contra Florentinos,

’ ut ipse vocat, intrinsecos scripsit. Et quos ante id tempus honori-

’ ficentissimis compellare solebat verbis, tunc huius spe supra modum

elatus, acerbissime insectari non dubitat’ (Lib. IV, p. 88, ed.
Argentoraffi, MDCX). No one who compares the phraseology of
‘this passage with that of the quotation from Manetti’s Vita Dantis
given above can have much doubt that this was the source from
which Manetti's account of the letter was derived. This passage
also proves, what Zenatti doubted, that, whether or no Manetti had
a first-hand acquaintance with the letter, Bruni certainly had.
Manetti’s acquisition of the MS. containing the letter must have
been subsequent to the compilation of his Vita Dantis, otherwise he
would surely have utilized it for the purposes of his work.
