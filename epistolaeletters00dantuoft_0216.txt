¹ This nephew, as stated above in the introductory note, was
perhaps N iccolo di Foresino di Manetto Donati, the son of a brother
of Dante’s wife Gemma. He was an adult at this time, for he
took part in the battle of Montecatini (Aug. 29, 1315> ; he is known
to have been in intimate relations with Dante's family, and there
is reason to believe that his aunt Gemma, Dante’s widow, died in

his house (see Della Torre, Bull. Soc. Dant. Ital„ N.S. xii. 158-9).
² That is, the amnesty of May 19, 1315 (see note on date above).
³ On the probable amount of this fine, see Bull. Soc. Dant.1tal.‚

. N.S. xi. 26, and xii. 154-5.

⁴ The oblatio (or ‘offering') was a ceremony which had to be
performed by malefactore, or political offenders after condemna·
tion, as a condition of pardon. If a malefactor, he was conducted
from the prison where he had been confined, clothed in sack—cloth,
with a mitre on his head, and a candle in his hand, to the
Baptistery of San Giovanffi, where he was solemnly offered by
an approved sponsor at the altar to God and to the Baptist. An
individual who had been condemned for a political offanae, if not
actually a prisoner, was obliged to constitute himself one technically
by crossing the threshold of a prison, whence he was conducted to
the Baptistery3 but the wearing a mitre and other degrading
conditione were usually dispensed with in such a case. cf. the
’ following extract from the Provvisione of June 2, 1316: ‘possint
eisque liceat intrari in carceribus Stincharum seu Vollognani aut
in quocumque alio carcere dicti Comunis Florentio, et postquam
fuerint in claustro seu intra muros circumdantes aliquem ipsorum
carcerum, non obstante eo quod ipsi non scribantur per notarium
