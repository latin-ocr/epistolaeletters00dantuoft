perfuderunt (v), quantam nemo valeret (pl) seu verbo seu
cogitatiene metiri (pl).'

The same test applied to any of the other letters, with
the exception of the argumentative and expository portions
of Eipist. x (to Can Grande), will be found to give similar
resu ts.

¹ Compounn GLAUSULAE.

A striking feature of the cursus as employed by Dante
in the Epistolae, which, however, is not peculiar to Dante
nor to the Epistolae, though it is strongly marked in the
latter, is the frequent use of what may be termed com-
bined or compound clausulae, that is to say, clausulae in
which two or more of the recognized cursus formulae are
used in combination3 ae, for example, ‘ rabies inopina
turgescet' (vii. 128—9), which is a combination of the
velox, ‘rabies inopina ', with the planus, ‘ (ino)p1'na tur-
gescet ' (v 4-le 3 or, ‘ nevus agricola Romanerum ' (v. 82),
which is a combination of the tardus, ‘nevus agricola ',
with the velox, ‘ (a)gr1'cola Romanerum ' (t-l-v); or, ‘(quid
tam) sera moretur segnities admiramur ' (vii. 47-8), which
is a combination of the planus, ‘sera moretur ', with the
tardus, ‘(mo)retur segnities ³, and of this again with the
velox, ‘(seg)n1'ties admiramur' (pl÷t÷v); or, ‘viduam et
desertam lugere compellimur ' (viii. 29-30), which is
a combination of the velox, ‘viduam et desertam ⁹, with
the plwnus, ‘ (de)sertam lugere ⁹, and of this with the tarduS,
‘ (lu)gere compellimur ' (v ÷pl÷ t) ; and so on.

If we examine the specimen passages above quoted from
this point of view we shall find in the first (from Epist.
vii) eight instances3 namely in 1. 2: ⁴ nobis est pacis
hereditas’ (φῖ-θὴς 11. 9-10: ‘impie denudavit invitos'
(v-l-pl); l. 13: ‘saevi tyranni disperderet ' (pl-l-t) ; l. 14:
‘ nestra iustitia reformaret' (t÷v); 1. 15: ‘Caesaris et
Augusti successor' (v ÷pl); 1. 17: ‘signa Tarpeia retu-
listi' (t÷v); ll. 18-19: ‘(lacrymaJrumque diluvia desie-
runt' (ύ-ι-υἷς ll. 20-1: ‘saeculi melieris effulsit' (v -1- pl) ;
in the second (from Epist. ix) seven instances; in 1. 3:
‘ curae sit vebis et animo ' (μή-ἰὴ ll. 6—7: ‘exules
