Vatican were many which had formed part of the Fugger
collection, one of them being this MS.¹ containing the nine
letters attributed to Dante discovered by Heyse.

Witte, having received copies of the letters from Heyse,
wrote an account of them, with copious (translated) ex-
tracts, in an article entitled Neu aufyefundene Briesc des
Dante Alliqhieri,² which appeared in Bla'tter fiir literarische
Unterhaltuny in May, 1838, and prepared to edit and
publish them. But while he was engaged upon the work
his portfolio containing the transcript of the letters was
stolen from him, and it was more than two years before
he could succeed in getting fresh copies made.3 In the
meantime, attention having been directed to the Ms. by
the publication of Witte’s article, one of the employes at
the Vatican Library, Massi by name, took copies of the
letters on his own account with the intention of fore-
stalling Witte's projected edition. Massi, however, was
unable to obtain the necessary imprimatur, and he then
(in the autumn of 1841) offered his copies to Alessandro
'Porri of Pisa, who had been for some time engaged upon

parte tutte quelle coperte, per veder quanto luogho occupavano
e quanto pesavano, e trovai che non bastavano mancho tredici carri,
e fu giudicato che pesassero passa duecento centinara' (op. cit„
· p. 25).

¹ Now aod. Vaticano-Palatino Latino 1729.

² In this article Witte omitted to mention the name of the
student to whom the discovery was due, an omission which he did
not repair until four years later, in 1842, in which year he
acknowledged his indebtedness to Heyse in the Appendix to the
second part of Dante Aliyhieri's lyrische Gedichte, ubersetzt und erklc‘irt
von K. L. Kanneqiesser und K. Witte (p. 234).

³ For this second. transcript Witte was indebted once more to
Heyse <see Le Latiare di Dante scoperte dal Siynor Teodoro Heyse, in

3 vol. ii, p. 701, of Niccolo Tommaseo’s edition of the Divina conamedia,
ἶ Milano, 1865).
