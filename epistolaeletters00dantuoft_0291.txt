APPENDIX C 229

either by a paroxytone trisyllable preceded by a mono·
syllable; 33, civitas Ι est Romana; (vic)t6riam Ι sunt
adepti; or by two dissyllables· , as, 1193019113Ι l atque
nolens; (uten)silia Ι Dei sumus.

Α3 m the 0339 of the planus and tardus, by the substi-
tution of two unaccented syllables for one after the
caesura, we get a secondary form of velow (22²), of the type
fletibus Ι 111191119131113; callide Ι considerantes.
. A further variety of the cursus velox (υὸ), which by

some is designated cursus octosyllabieus,¹ has an additional
syllable at the end, of the type fletibus Ι supplicantium· ,
(amari)tudinem Ι poenitentiae.

It may be noted 111 passing that the cursus velox (in its
normal form) was by far the most popular of the three
types of clausula m the mediaeval cursus, and was usually
assigned the post of honour at the end of the period.²
De Santi quotes3 an interesting dictum on this subject
from one of the mediaeval text-books 011 dictamen, which,
as he observeS‚ enforces the point by example 33 well 33
by precept, the sentence ending with a sonorous velox:
‘Cursus tamen velox maiorem ornatum efficit, 91 ideo
a dictatoribus comml'miter acceptatur)

Cursus Medius·

Besides the normal forms of planus, tardus, and velox,
and their variations as described above, yet another form
of clausula was admitted, to which the name of cursus
medius (m) has been given,⁴ consisting of a proparoxytone

² See De Santi, op. cit„ p. 263 Clark, op. cit„ pp. 18, 19.

² Dante, for example, concludes the De Monarchia with the velox,
‘ temporalium gubernator’ ; and his letter to Gan Grande (Epist. x)
with another, ‘in saecula saeculorum'3 so also Epist. iv (iii),
‘praesentium requiratis’; Epist. vii, ‘in gaudio recolemus'3 and
Epist. viii, ‘posteris in exemplum'3 even the Vita Nuova, which
ends with a Latin sentence, concludes with a velox, ‘saecula
benedlctus’.

Parodi, in Buce. Soc. Dant. Ital„ N.S. xix. 256-7. In this category
are also placed by some the clausulae classed above as plana-3⁴ and
tardus⁸ (see above, p. 227, 11. 4 ; p. 228, 11. 3).
