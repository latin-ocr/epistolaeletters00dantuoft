18 LETTERS OF DANTE

his outward blazon he bore silver scourges on a purple
field,l and inwardly a mind repellent of vice in its love
of virtue. Lament, therefore, lanient, thou noblest of the
houses of Tuscany, that shone with the light of so great
a man! Lament, all ye his friends and servants, whose
hope death hath so cruelly stricken ; and among the last,
woe is me! must Ι too lament, who, driven from my
country, in undeserved exile, was wont, as Ι brooded
over my unhappy fate with unceasing anxiety, to console
myself with the hope which I rested in him.

ξ 2. But although the bitterness of grief weigh upon
us for the loss of corporeal things, yet, when we consider
the intellectual things which remain, surely before the
eyes of the mind must arise the light of sweet consolation.
For he, by whom virtue was honoured on earth, is now
held in honour of the Virtues in heaven ; and he who was
a Palatine of the Gourt of Rome in Tuscany now glories
as a chosen courtier with the princes of the Blest in the
everlasting palace of the Jerusalem which is above.
Wherefore, my beloved Lords, with humble exhortation
I beseech you to grieve not overmuch, and to put behind
you bodily concerns, save in so far as they may serve you
for examples3 and as he himself, a most just man,
appointed you to be the heirs of his possessions‚ so do
you, as those nearest to him, clothe yourselves with his
most excellent qualities.

ξ 3. But I must add a word on my own behalf, in
appeal to your judgement, to excuse myself, as your
servant, for my absence from the mournful ceremony;
for it was neither neglect nor ingratitude which kept me
away, but the unlooked-for poverty brought about by
exile. Poverty, like a vindictive fury, has thrust me,
deprived of horses and arms, into her prison den, where
she has set herself relentlessly to keep me in durance;
and though Ι struggle with all my strength to get free,
she has hitherto prevailed against me.

1 Heraldically‚ ‘pu1·pure, scourges argent '.
