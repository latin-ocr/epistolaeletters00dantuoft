Cardinal in 1278 by Nicholas III, the latter (d. 1326) by Nicholas IV
in 1288, had been deprived in 1297 by Boniface VIII as an incident
in his contest with their house, which culminated in his capture
at Anagni in 1303 by Sciarra Golonna, the uncle of the two
Cardinals3 Clement V had restored them to their dignity, but
sine titulo, in Dec. 1305, apparently at the time of his first creation
of Cardinals (Dec. 15). In a Bull of Clement’s addressed from
Lyons on Jan. 2, 1306, ‘DiL filio Iacobo de Columpna Sancte
Romane ecclesie diacono cardinali ⁹, Jacopo is referred to as ‘tu
per nos reassumptus ad cardinalatus statum ’.

1 The abbreviation in the MS. might stand for populo, or proprio,
or propositio, of which the first alone would make any sense here,
and that not very satisfactory. I think it probable that Dante
wrote perpetuo, and that the present reading of the MS. is a corrup-
tion due to a careless or ignorant copyist. This conjecture is
confirmed by the language of Boniface VIII in his Bull of depriva-
tion (May 10, 1297), in which he says: ‘prefatos Iacobum Sancte
Marie in Via Lata et Petrum Sancti Eustachii diaconos cardinales
. . . a cardinalatibus ipsis Sancte Romane Ecclesie et predictarum*
ecclesiarum deponimus3 omnibus cardinalatus seu cardlnalatuum
iuribus, comodis, utilitatibus, honoribus, proventibus, fructibus,
redditibus, obventionibus et quibuscumque ad cardinalatum vel
cardinalatus ipsos spectantibus privamus perpetuo . . . reddentes
ipsos et unumquemque ipsorum perpetuo inhabiles ad apicem
apostolice dignitatis et cardinalatus honorem seu statum . . .' <see
Reyistres de Boniface VIII: Lettres curiales, No. 2388, ed. Digard‚
Faucon et Thomas, Paris, 1884 ff). Ι have consequently ventured
to adopt perpetuo in the text.

² Cf. Epist. vii. 16-17 ε ‘veneranda signa Tarpeia ’ (of the Imperial
ensign). There is perhaps a reference here to the proclamation of
Boniface VIII of May 23, 1297, in which J acopo and Pietro Colonna
are forbidden to use the style and insignia of cardinal—‘cardinales
se nominare et cardinalitia portare insignia annulis et rubeis

capellis utentes ' (see Potthast, Reyesta Romanorum Pontificum,
No. 24519).
