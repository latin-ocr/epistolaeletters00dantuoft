EPISTOLA 111 (1v) 21

from Pistoja with the Bianehi; but as the result of recent
researeh it appears that Oino belonged, not to the Bianchi‚
but to the Neri, and that his exile from Pistoja coincided with
that of the Neri from 1301 to 1306.1 Consequently‚ if 01110
be the Pistojan exile of the title, the letter must have been
written during the period between those two dates—probably
in 1305 or 1306 ²—and certainly before the letter to Moroello
Malaspina,3 which has hitherto been placed third (instead of
fourth as now) in order of the letters of Dante}

SUMMARY.-§ 1. 01110 having inquired⁵ as to whether the
soul ean pass ‘from passion to passion’ 3 §2. Dante replies
that the answer is in the affirmative, as will be found in the
poem⁶ subjoined to his letter. §3.Tha1·, it is so is proved by

1 See A. Corbellini‚ eino da Pistoja : Amore ed Esilio (Pavia, 1898);
and M. Barbi in Ball. Soc. Dant. Ital„ Ns. vi. 209, 247.

² See Zenatti, Dante 0 Firma, pp. 245 ff.

³ See below, pp. 31-2.

⁴ In the present work, in order so far as possible to avoid eon-
fusion 111 the ease of these two letters, the old numeration has
been given (in brackets) as well as the new.

⁶ In his sonnet beginning ‘Dante‚ quando per caso s'abbandona ’
(see below, p. 26, n. 1).

⁶ This poem has been identified with the sonnet, ‘ Io sono stato
0011 Amore insieme' (So‘n. xxxvi in the Oxsord Dante), which in
accordanee with the convention of the day is in the same rhymes
as that of 01110 (see below, p. 26, n. 1). This correspondenee between
Dante and Cino on the subject of the mutability of love was
known to 00000 d’Ascoli (1257-1327), who refers to it in his
Acerba3 he holds that love ‘Non si disparte altro 0110 per morte ⁹,

- and he takes upon him to confuto Dante's theory :—

Ma Dante reserivendo a misser 01110,
Α11101· 11011 vide in questa pura forma,
Che tosto avria cambiato suo latino:

Io sono con Amore stato insieme.

Qui pose Dante, 0110 nuovi speroni
Sentir pub il fianeo con la nuova speme.
Contra tal detto dico quel eh’ io sento,
Formando filosofiche rasoni —-

Se Dante poi le solve, io son contente.
(IV. i, 11. 64-72.)
