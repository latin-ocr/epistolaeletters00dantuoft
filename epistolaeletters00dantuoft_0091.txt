EPISTOLA IV (ΙΙΙ) 29

Reason or virtue who 'gainst him puts forssh
Is like to one should pipe amid the storm‚
And think thereby to quell the thunder's rage,
And calm the warring elements on high.
Wherefore within the compass of his darbs
Free-will for ever in his danger lies;
'Gainsiz him in vain will counsel's shaft be sped.
For with new spur his victim’s flank he'll ply3

And be the new-born passion what it may,
This will be master, if the other pall.]
