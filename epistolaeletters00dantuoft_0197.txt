1 Dionysius the Areopagite, the Athenian whose conversion to
Christianity by the preaching of St. Paul is mentioned in the Acts
(xvii. 34). He was credited with the authorship of a work on the
celestial Hieramhy, which was translated into Latin in Cent. ix
and became the mediaeval text-book of angelic lore ς and of another
on the Names of eod, both of which were known to, and utilized
by, Dante. cf. Epist. x, 405, and note.

² John of Damascus, c. 680-756; his most important work was
an exposition of the orthodox faith‚'which was translated into
Latin in Oent. xii under the title De Fide Orthoczoxa.

³ Venerable Bede, c. 673-735; author of an Ecclesiastical History
of England‚ and numerous other works‚ chiefly ecclesiastical.

⁴ The Speculum Ιαάίσίαῑε, commonly known as the Speculum Iuris,
a treatise on civil and canon law, written c. 1270 by Wilhelmus
Durandus (1237-96>‚ who subsequently (1286) became Bishop of
Mende in Languedoc.

⁶ Probably Innocent IV, Pope, 1243-54; 116 was originally
professor of law at Bologna, and was one of the most learned
canonists of his time.

⁸ ‘Him of Ostia ’, that is, Henry of Susa (Enrico Bartolomei)‚
c. 1200-713 he lectured on canon law at Bologna and Paris, and
became Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia in 1261, whence he was commonly
styled Ostiensis ; his most famous work was the Summa super
titulis Decretalium, otherwise known as Summa Ostiensis. Dante
refers to him as ‘ Ostiense ' in Par. xii. 83.

⁷ With this denunciation of the Italian Cardinals for their devo-
tion to the works of the Decretalists in their tempora] interests‚ in
preference to the works of the Fathers of the cnm-oh, cf. Par. ix·
133-5: ‘Per questo (the Florentine florin) l’ Evangelio e i Dottor

magni Son derelitti, e solo ai Decretali Si studia si che pare ai lor
vivagm '.
