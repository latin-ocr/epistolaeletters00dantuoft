ments, therefore, as to matters of fact, of which he claims
to have had personal cognizance, are entitled to the
respect due to a writer of established reputation and
authority. Among such statements in his Vita di Dante,
which was written in 1436, by way of diversion‚ after the
completion of his translation of the Poetics of Aristotle,
and while he was still engaged upon the last books of his
history of Florence‚ are several of the highest interest
relating to the letters of Dante.

Bruni mentions that he had himself seen several letters
written by Dante’s own hand, and he describes the hand-
writing—the only description that has come down to us
—as being ‘fine and slender and very accurate ἐ ⁴ Di sua
mano egregiamente disegnava. Fu ancora scrittore per-
fetto‚ ed era la lettera sua magra, e lunga, e molto corretta,
secondo io ho veduto in alcune epistole di sua propria
= mano scritte '—-a statement which recurs in another work
of his, the Dialogus ad Petrum Histrum, where, speaking
of Dante, he says: ‘ legi nuper quasdam eius litteras quas
ille videbatur peraccurate scripsisse: erant enim propria
manu atque eius sigillo obsignatae '. ‘Scrisse molte
epistole in prosa‚’ he says in his list of the poet’s works
in the Vita, and in the course of the work he specifically
mentions or refers to at least half a dozen, giving in the
case of one of them a long quotation in Dante's own
words,l and 'in the case of another the opening sentence.

The first letter mentioned by Bruni is in connexion

maggior notizia delle cose stimabili z ne questo saceio per derogare
al Boccaccio; ma perche lo scriver mio sia quasi un supplimento

allo scriver di lui.’
¹ Bruni givesthe quotation in Italian, with the remark ‘queste

sono le parole sue ’ ; but the original, like the rest of Dante’s letters
with which we are acquainted, was doubtless written in Latin.
