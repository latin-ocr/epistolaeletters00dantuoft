Love, therefore, reigns within me, with 110 restraining
influenoe3 and in what manner he rules me you must
inquire from what follows below outside the limits of
this present writing. ’

[Οανιεοηε.]

[Love‚ since 'tis meet that I should tell my woe,
'I'hat men may list to me,
And show myself with all my manhood gone,
Grant that I may content in weeping know;
So that my grief set free
My words may utter, with my sense at one.
Thou will'st my death, and I consent 1311616011 ;
Β1113 who will pardon if I laok the art
To tell my pain of heart‘?
Who will believe what now doth me constrain‘?
But if from thee fit words for grief are wou,
Grant, O my Lord, that, ere my life depart,
That oruel fair one may not hear my pain,
For, of my inward. grief were she made ware,
Sorrow would make her beauteous face >less fair.
. Ι cannot soape from her, but she will come
Within my phantasy‚
More 1311611 1 6611 13116 thought that brings her theret
The frenzied 60111 1311613 brings its own ill home,
Painting 1161· faithfully,
Lovely and. stem, 1136 own doom doth prepare:
Then looks on her, and when it filled (101311 fare
With the great longing springing from mine eyes,
Wroth with itself doth 1166,
Τ11613 1113 the fire where it, poor soul! doth burn.
What plea of reason oalms the stormy air
When such 6 tempest whirls ο’61· inward skies‘?
The grief 113 cannot hold breaks forth in sighs‚
From out my lips that others too may learn,
And gives mine eyes the 136616 they truly earn.
The image of my fair foe which doth stay
“ Victorious and proud,
And lords 113 ο’61 my faculty of will,
Desirous of itself, doth make me stray
There, where its truth is shewed,
As like to like its course directing still.
Like snow thatseeks the sun, so fare Ι 111;

Β1113 Ι 6111 powerless, and I am as they
Who thither take their way
