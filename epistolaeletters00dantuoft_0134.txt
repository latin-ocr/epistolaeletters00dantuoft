1 Saguntum (an ancient town on the E. coast of Spain, on the
site of the present Murviedro) was on friendly terms wit-h the
Romans, and its siege by Hannibal (219-218 Re.) was the imme-

previous clause, occurs frequently in the vulgate (e. g. John vi. 43 ;
Rom. i. 27 ; xiv. 19; 1 Thess. iii. 123 v. 153 2 Thess. i. 3). This
