EPISTOLA VI 81

standing is manifestly in itself the most perfect liberty.
For what else is this liberty but the free passage from will
to act, which the laws make easy for those who obey them?
Seeing, then, that they only are free who of their own will
submit to the law, what do you call yourselves, who, while
you make pretence of a love of liberty, in defiance of every
law conspire against the Prince who is the giver of the
law ‘?

ξ 6. O most wretched offshoot of Fiesole 1 Ο barbarians
punished now a second time! Does the foretaste not
suffice to terrify you? Of a truth I believe that, for all
you simulate hope in your looks and lying lips, yet you
tremble in your waking hours, and ever start from your
dreams in terror at the portents which have visited you,
or rehearsing again the counsels you have debated bysday.
But if, while alarmed with good reason, you repent you
of your madneSS, yet feel no remorse, then, that the
>streams of fear and remorse may unite in the bitter waters
of repentance, bear this further 111 mind, that the guardian
of the Roman Empire, the triumphant Henry, elect of
God, thirsting not for his own but for the public good, has
for our sakes undertaken his heavy task, sharing our
pains of his own free will, as though to him, after Christ,
the prophet Isaiah had pointed the finger of prophecy,
when by the revelation of the spirit of God he declared‚

‘Surely he hath borne our gr iefs, and carried our sorrow s’.
Wherefore you perceive, if you be not dissemblers, that
the hour of bitter repentance for your mad presumption
is now at hand But a late repentance after this wise will
not purchase pardon, rather is it but the prelude to

seasonable chastisement. For ‘the sinner is smitten so
that he shall sur ely die'.

Written from beneath the springs of Arno, on the con·
fines ‘of Tuscany, on the thirty-first day of March in the
first year of the most auspicious passage of the Emperor
Henry into Italy.
