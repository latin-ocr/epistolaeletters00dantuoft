EPISTOLA X 163

Aumsnrr101mY.-Dante’s authorship of this letter has been

. vehemently contested,¹ but since the publication of Dr. Moore’s

exhaustive article on the subject in the third series of his
Studies in Dante? its authenticity may be regarded as definitely
established. The letter was known to and quoted by several of
the early commentators on the Commedia,³ among others to
Guido da Pisa and Jacopo della Lana, both of whose commen-
taries were written within a few years of Dante’s death.⁴

Drama—In the absence of detailed information with regard
to the last few years of Dante's life, it is difficult to assign
a precise date to the letter. From the epithet ‘ victoriosissimus ’
applied to Gan Grande in the title, it is obvious that it must
have been written before Aug. 25, 1320, the date of Gan
Grande’s disastrous defeat before Padum on the other hand
this epithet would be appropriate in or shortly after 1318, in
which year (April) Can Grande took Cremona, and was elected
(Dec.) Captain General of the Ghibelline League in Lombardy.
The most probable date seems to be 1319 (Dante being then the
guest of Guido da Polenta at Ravenna), at which time, as we
know from Ecloque i, though the Paradiso was not yet finished
(11. 48-50)‚⁶ ten cantos were completed (l. 64).6
