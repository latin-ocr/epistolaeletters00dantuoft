xxx LETTERS OF DANTE

what he knew of his own personal knowledge, or had
seen with his own eyes—⁴ ea dumtaxat refero, quae certo
scio, quaeque ipse vidi, cetera non ausim affirmare '.
Apart from palpable misstatemen’ts of fact, instances of
which have been pointed out by Bartoli and others,¹
there are at least two demonstrable falsifications in this
same work. When he comes to deal with the De
Monarchia and the De Vulyarz‘ Eloquentia, in his account
of Dante’s writings‚ Filelfo, as in the case of the three
letters above mentioned, makes a parade of quoting the
beginnings of each of these treatises:

Romano quidem stilo edidit opus, cui Monarchiae dedit
nomen, cuius hoc est principium: ‘Magnitudo eius, qui
sedens in throno cunctis dominatur, in caelo stans omnia
videt, nusquam exclusus, nullibi est inclusus, ita dividit
gratia munera, ut mutos aliquando faciat loqui.' Edidit
et opus de Vulgari Eloquentia hoc principio z ‘ Ut Romana
lingua in totum est orbem nobilitata terrarum, ita nostri
cupiunt nobilitare suam ; proptereaque difficilius est hodie
recte nostra quam perite latina quidquam dicere?

A glauce at the actual beginnings of the Dc Monarehia
and De Vulyari Eloquentia will suffice to show that these
alleged quotations by Filelfo do not bear the smallest
resemblance to what Dante really wrote, and are in fact
unblushing fabrications on Filelfo’s part—fabrications, it
may be explained, in which it was comparatively safe for
him to indulge, in view of the circumstance that the
treatises in question existed only in MS. at that time,²'
and that the MSS. were few and not easily accessible.
