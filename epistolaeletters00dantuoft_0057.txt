6. To the Counts Oberto and Guido da Romena
(Epist. ii).

7. To the Marquis Moroello Malaspina (Epist. iv (iii))‚
this being the letter mentioned above as having been
printed by Witte in Dante’s lyrische Gedichte.¹

8. To the Cardinal Niccolo da Prato (Epist. i).

9. To the Princes and Peoples of Italy (Epist. v), which
had been printed in an Italian version by Lazzari in 1754.

Of these nine letters, five are definitely ascribed to
Dante by name in the MS. ; while it is evident, from the
places assigned to them in the midst of the others, that
the remaining four, namely the three to the Empress
and that to the Cardinal Niccolo, were regarded by the
compiler of the collection as having been written by
Dante.

With 'I'orri’s edition of the letters finality was reached
so far as numbers are concerned. This total consisted of
fourteen letters, which was made up ofsthe three from the
Laurentian Ms„ the nine from the Vatican MS„ the letter
to Can Grande, and the letter to Guido da Polenta; that
is to say, his edition included the ten letters now usually
accepted as Dante's (Epistles i to x in the Oxford Dante),
together with the three Battifolle letters, as to which
doubts still exist,2 and the Polenta letter, now almost
universally recognized as a falsification.

In 1857 Fraticelli published at Florence a revised
edition of the letterS‚ in which were embodied sundry
emendations, the results of a fresh collation of the MSS. by
