EPISTOLA IV (ΙΙΙ) 33

states1 that, according to some, it was to Moroello that Dante
dedicated the Purqatorio.

SUMMARY.-—§ 1. Lest false reports should reach Moroello
as to the cause of his silence, Dante writes to explain the real
reason, and thereby to excuse himself from the charge of
neglect. §2 On reaching the banks of the Arno, after his
departure from the court of Moroello, he was suddenly con-
founded by the apparition of a lady, at the sight of whom, in
spite of all his previous resolutioris to keep his thoughts from
women, Love once again took possession of him, and, making
an end of his meditations upon higher things, reduced him
to a state of utter subjection to his will, in which condition
he now writes. The manner in which Love exercises his
tyranny Moroello will learn from the canzone² which accom-
panies the letter.
