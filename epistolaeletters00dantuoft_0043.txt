-INTRODUCTION xxxvii

In which letter he treats of certain matterS, with a view
to the better understanding of his purpose in the poem,
and among others of the reason why he gave to it this
title of Commodia. He points out that Comedy differs
from Tragedy in its subject-matter, inasmuch as Tragedy
in its beginning is admirable and quiet, but in its ending
foul and horrible (these being our author's own expres-
sions), whereas Comedy begins with an element of
adversity‚ but in the end turns out happily--a circum-
stance, he adds, which has given rise to the employment
by some letter-writers of the salutation, ‘tragicum princi-
pium, et comicum finem,’ as a substitute for the conven-
tional greeting. Again, 119 shows that Comedy differs
from Tragedy in the style of its diction, the language of
Tragedy being lofty and inflated, while that of Comedy is

, unstudied and homely; whence he concludes [and Gelli

here quotes the original text of Dante’s letter]: ‘Et per
hoc patet quod Comoedia dicitur praesens opuS. Nam si
ad materiam aspiciamus, a principio horribilis et foetida
est, quia Infernus3 in fine prospera, desiderabilis et grata,

’ quia Paradisus. Ad modum loquendi, remissus est modus
. et humilis, quia locutio vulgaris, in qua et mulierculae
’ comunicant; et sic patet, quia Comoedia dicitur.·' 1

Gelli quotes the letter a second time in another lecture,
of which only a fragment has been preserved, in con-
nexion with Dante’s scathing apostrophe to Florence at
the beginning of the twenty-sixth canto of the Inferna
⁴ Not only ⁹, he sayS, ‘did Dante rebuke Florence in this
place, and in numerous other passages in his works, but
he twice in the letter he sent to Can Grande, Lord of
Verona, with a copy of his poem, describes himself in
these terms: “Dantes Alagherius, Florentinus patria, sed
non moribus ''.' ²
