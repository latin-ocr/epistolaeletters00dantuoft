2 ‘The Transteverine faction' was the party of the Guelfs, and
included the Orsini and Gaetani, as opposed to the Ghibelline
party, with whom the Colonnesi were identified, and whose head-
quarters were on the left bank of the Tiber (see Torraca, in Bull.
Soc. Dant. Ital„ ΝΒ. xvii. 175). Τ110 individual here in question
was Francesco Gaetani‚ nephew of Boniface VIII, by whom he
was made a Cardinal in 12953 he was a staunch supporter of
Boniface in his contest with the Golonnesi, and after the death
of the former continued to carry out his policy.

3 Namely, Boniface VIII (see previous note).

⁴ That is, ‘as though thou wert at heart afoe to Rome ⁷, Carthago

· having been the secular enemy of Rome. The ‘ illustrious Scipios'

specially indicated would be Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus
Major, 234-0. 183 B. c., the conqueror of Hannibal at the battle of
Zama, 202 13.c. (cf. Ins. xxxi. 115-173 Par. xxvii. 61-2 3 Gonv. iv. 15,
11. 170-1; Mon. ii. 11, ll. 59-61); and his grandson by adoption,
Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus Minor, c. 185-
129 Β. 0., by whom Carthage was taken and. destroyed 146 Β.0.

⁵ I am indebted to Dr. Heberden for pointing out that the MS.
reading of this passage (except for the blunder of quod for qui)
stands in need of no emendation, Dante evidently having had in
mind 2 Peter iii. 7: ‘ Coeli autem qui nunc sunt, et terra . . . igni
reservati in diem iudicii '.
