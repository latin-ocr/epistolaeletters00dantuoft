l LETTERS OF DANTE

an edition of the minor works of Dante. 'Porri availed
himself of the offer, and forthwith proceeded to Rome for
the purpose of collating the copies with the original MS.
in the Vatican. Having satisfied himself as to their
accuracy, he included the nine letters in his volume,
Epistola di Dante Alliyhieri edite e inedito, which was
published at Leghorn at the end of the following year
(1842).1 It should be mentioned that before the publica·
tion of Torri’s volume Witte had printed the text of one
of the letters in the Vatican MS. in an Appendix to
the second volume of Dante Aliyhieri’s lyrische Gedichte,2
published by Karl Ludwig Kannegiesser and himself at
Leipzig earlier in the same year.

Of the letters contained in the Vatican MS. all except
one, namely that to the Emperor Henry VII, were now
made known for the first time, or for the first time in the
original Latin text. The letters, in the order of their
occurrence in the MS., are as follows:

1. To the Emperor Henry VII (Epist. vii), the Latin
text of which had been printed by Witte in his collected
edition 111 1827 from the Marcian MS.

2. To the Florentines (Epist. vi)—‘scelestissimis Floren—
tinis intrinsecis ', the title and contents of which prove it
to be the abusive letter mentioned by Bruni and Manetti ·
as having been written by Dante to the Florentines after
the coming of Henry VII into Italy.³

3, 4, 5. Three short letters written in the name of
a Countess of Battifolle to Margaret of Brabant, wife of
the Emperor Henry (Epist. vii*, vii**‚ vii***).
