xxviii LETTERS OF DANTE

Beatrice wasa mythical, not a real personage—about as
real as Pandora, is the author’s way of putting it—
Filelfo makes very free use of the Vita. of Leonardo Bruni.
He does not, however, confine himself to merely repeating
what Bruni says, but embellishes his statements with
characteristic additions of his own. Thus, in his account
of Dante’s letter about the battle of Campaldino, he makes
Dante claim not only to have been present, but to have
taken a leading part in the engagement: ‘Hanc quider'n
et pugnam et victoriam recitat ipse Dantes sua quadam
epistola, declaratque se iisce interfuisse ac praefuisse rebus,
exprimitque omnem eius proelii ordinem? Again, where
Bruni simply mentions that Dante, in order to obtain his
recall from exile, wrote to individual members of.the
Government as well as to the people of Florence, Filelfo
states that he wrote letters to several particular citizens
whom he believed to be more upright than the rest, and
also sundry very lengthy letters to the Florentino people:
‘Patriae gratiam assidue cupiens, plures epistolas nedum
ad nonnullos misit civeS, quos intelliyeret virtuti dedica·
tiores, sed ad populum longiusculas admodum dedit
litteras.' Bruni’s succinet description of Dante’s hand-
writing, which has been quoted above, is amplified by
Filelfo into a detailed statement as to Dante's delight in
the exercise of the pen, and, so far as his ignorance of
Greek would allow, the perfect accuracy of his spelling:

Delectabatur Dantes scribendi forma, et vetustate lit·
terarum, scribebatque litteras modernas, tamen politissi-
mas, sed longiores subtilioresque, ut se illa manu scriptas
fatetur habuisse Leonardus Aretinus, qui fuit earum
diligens inquisitor, sed orthographiam tenebat ad unguem,
quantum poterat, sine litterarum graecarum cognitione,
conficere.
