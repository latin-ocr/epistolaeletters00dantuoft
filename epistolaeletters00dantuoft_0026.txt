xx LETTERS OF DANTE

with the battle of Oampaldin0‚ the decisive victory of the
Florentino Guelfs over the Ghibellines of Arezzo on
June 11, 1289, at which Dante, he says, was present as
a combatant, as he himself relates in a letter in which he
gives an account of the battle, accompanied by a plan of
the operations.1 The next has reference to Dante’s elec·
tion to the Priorate‚ ‘from which ⁹, he states, ‘sprang
Dante's exile from Florence and all the adverse fortunes
of his life, as he himself writes in one of his letters, the
words of which are as follows:

All my woes and all my missortunes had their origin
and commencement with my unlucky election to the
Priorate; of which Prior,ate although I was not worthy
in respect of worldly wisdom, yet in respect of loyalty
and of years I was not unworthy of it3 inasmuch as ten
years had passed since the battle of Campaldin0‚ whele
the Ghibelline party was almost entirely broken and
brought to an end ; on which occasion I was present, no
novice in 311115, and was in great sear, and afterwards

ffrffiffly elated‚ by reason of the varying fortunes of that
a e.

“ These are his words.' 2

¹ ‘Questa battaglia racconta Dante in una sua epistola, 6 (1166
esservi stato a combattere, 6 disegna 13 forma della battaglia.’

2 ‘Da questo priorato nacque la cacciata sua, e tutte 16 cose avverse,
che egli ebbe nella vita, secondo lui medesimo scrive in una sua
epistola, della quale 16 parole son queste: “Tutti li mali, 6 tutti
1’ inconvenienti miei dalli infausti comizi del mio priorato ebbero
cagione e principio ; (161 quale priorato benehe per prudenza io non
fussi degno, nientedimeno per fede, e per eta, non ne era indegno,
perocche dieci anni erano gia passati dopo 13 battaglia di Campal—
dino, nella quale 13 parte Ghibellina fu quasi al tutto morta
e disfatta‚ dove mi trovai non saneiullo nell’ armi, e dove ebbi
temenza molta, e nella fine grandissima allegrezza, per li vari casi
di quella battaglia.’' Queste sono 16 parole sue.y
