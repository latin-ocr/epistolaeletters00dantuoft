28 LETTERS OF DANTE

of the syllogism, the entrance to which lies open without
difficulty, may be left to your diligence for proof.¹

§4. It remains to consider the authority of Ovid in
the fourth book of the Metamorphoses, which bears
directly and literally upon our proposition ’ς †namely‚ the ,
passage wherein the author says†² (in the story of the
three sisters who were contemptuous of the son of
Semele), addressing the Sun, who after he had deserted
and neglected other nymphs of whom he had previously
been enamoured, was newly in love with Leucothoe,
‘What now, Son of Hyperion ⁹, and what follows.

§5. In conclusion, dearest brother, I exhort you, so
far as in you lies,³ to arm yourself with patience against
the darts of Nemesis. Read, Ι beg you, the Remedies
ayainst Fortuna, which are offered to us, as it were by
a father to his sons, by that most famous philosopher
Seneca3 and especially let that saying not pass from your
memory: ‘If ye were of the world, the world would
love his own.’

[Sonnet]

[I have passed my days in fellowship with Love
E'er since the circling Sun my ninth year closed3
I know how he can ply or curb or spur, Δ
And how folk laugh or grean who are his thralls.

¹ The argument appears to be as follows: Every faculty *not
destroyed by one act is reserved for another act 3 but, every faculty
of sense (if the organ survives) is a faculty not destroyed by one
act ; therefore, every faculty of sense (if the organ survives) is
reserved for another act3 but, the appetitive faculty is a faculty
of sense3 therefore, the appetitive faculty (if the organ survives)
is reserved for another act.

² This sentence is inserted conjecturally in the Latin text (sce
above, p. 24, n. 2).

³ ‘Ad potentiam’; Fraticelli takes the meaning to be: ‘wit-h
regard to, a propos of faculties' (⁴ dopo di questo che le nost-re
potenze risguarda ’).
