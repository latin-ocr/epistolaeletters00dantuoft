xxiv LETTERS OF DANTE

self, has no new information to give about the letters in
general. In speaking of Dante’s writings he merely
remarks: ⁴ In Latino sermone multas epistolas scripsit.'
He does specify one particular letter, however, elsewhere,
and incidentally in connexion with it he uses a significant
phrase which makes it appear that he must himself have
been acquainted with the letter in question, namely, that
written by Dante to 'the Florentines a} the time of the
advent of Hem·y,VII into Italy (Epist. vi). Bruni, as we
have seen, states that in this letter Dante wrote abusively
to the FlorentineS, calling them knaves and scoundrels.
Manetti‚ who when he follows Bruni usually follows him
so closely as almost to echo his words, in this instance
adds a detail which h'e could not have derived from
Bruni's Vita. When the Emperor, he says, sat down
before Florence to besiege it, the Florentine exiles flocked
to his camp from all sides, and Dante, full of hope and no
longer able to contain himself, indited an insulting
letter ‘to the Florentines within the city, as he himself
calls them ’—‘Proinde Dantes quoque se ulterius conti-
nere non potuit, quin spe plenus epistolam quandam ad
Florentinos‚ ut {pse vocat, intrinsecos contumeliosam sane
scriberet, in qua eos acerbissime insectatur ; quum ante-
hac de ipsis honorificentissime loqui solitus esset ’. This
letter, as has already been mentioned, happens to be one
of those which have come down to us. Manetti’s refer-
ence to the title of it, which runs: ‘Dantes Alagherii
Florentinus et exul immeritus scelestissimis Florem-mis
intrinsecis ³, is unmistakable, and conveys the impression
that he had a personal knowledge of at least this one of
Dante's letters, though, unlike Bruni, he does not inform
us of the fact. That this was actually the case has
recently been demonstrated by Zenatti in his Dante
