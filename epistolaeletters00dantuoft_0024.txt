xviii LETTERS OF DANTE

Of special importance is the testimony of the next
witness, Leonardo Bruni of Arezzo (otherwise known as
Leonardo Aretino), the author of the most valuable‚ from
the critical point of view, of the early lives of Dante.
Bruni was not only the most distinguished humanist of
his day, but as secretary to several Popes ¹ and Chancellor
of the Florentino Republic, and as historiari of the
Republic, he was experienced in the handling of State
papers and in the appraisement of documentary evidence,
important qualifications possessed in an equal degree by
no other of the early biographers of Dante. He sets out
to write as a serious historian, with the express purpose
of supplying the practical deficiencies of Boccaccio's bio-
graphy, which he holds to be overburdened with details
of lovers' sighs and tears, and such like trivialities, to the
neglect of the weightier matters of life, as though, 116
says, man were born into this world for no other purpose
than to figure in a tale of the Decameron.² Bruni’s state-

1 Α5 secretary to Pope John XXIII, Bruni was in attendance at
the Council of Constance, where, as Dr. Moore points out (Dante
and his early Bioyraphers, p. 65), he would have met Giovanni da
,SerravallQ the translator and. commentator of the Divina Commedia,
who is responsible for the interesting but unhappily not otherwise
authenticated statement, that Dante came to England and was
a student at Oxford—-a matt-er to which Bruni makes no reference.
