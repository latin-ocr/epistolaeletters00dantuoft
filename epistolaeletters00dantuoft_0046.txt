r xl LETTERS OF DANTE

book ² he says: ‘It is shown in this chapter that Dante’s
poem was composed by him in the form of a vision, as he
himself has openly declared in his Vita Nuova, as well as
in a Latin letter which he sent to Cane della Scala,
explaining the purpose of the third cantica of his poem;
which letter was sent to me from Florence a few days ago
by Signor Domenico Mellini, a most worthy gentleman

a d lover of letters.'

&He then proceeds to excuse himself from discussing the
letter at that point, on the ground that it was his intention
to speak of it at length in his second volume. This
second volume, however, which was not published till
1688, ninety years after Mazzoni's death, unfortunately
contains no reference to the letter3 whence it has been
concluded either that his projected disquisition on the
subject was never written, or that it was suppressed by
his editor.

In the seventeenth century we find notice sor the
first time of the existence of the Latin text of the letter
to the Emperor Henry VII. This occurs in the notes
(first printed in 1636) 011 the De Rebus Gestis Henrici
Septimi of Albertino Mussato by Lorenzo Pignoria of
Padua (1571—1631), who states that he had in his own
possession a Ms. of this text; he identifies the letter with
that mentioned by Villani, and with that printed in
Italian by Doni, and promises to publish it—a promise
which remained unfulfilled.

‘Dantes vatum clarissimus,’ he writes, ‘hisce diebus
epistolam scripsit Henrico, quam nacti in. pervetusto ’
codice, nostro manuscripto publici iuris facere decrevimus,

which is not paged in the original 1587 edition.
