APPENDIX c ’ 239

Taking into account only those compound clausulae the
members of which consist of the normal forms of planus,
tardus, and velox, and leaving out of consideration those
into whose composition one or other of the various alter-
native or secondary forms enters, we find the following
types (divided into two classeS, according as they are com·
posed of two, or three, members) represented in Dante’s
Epistolae ε

Α. Clausulae composed of two memberS.

i. With planus final.

(pl ἠοῖ), as ε

⁴ equis armisque vacantem ' (ii. 51-2).

⁴ pauci cum fletu cernetis ' (vi. 121-2).
(υ ÷10l), as:

⁴ impia retinere molitur ’ (ii. 54).

⁴ merito trepidatis adventum ' (v. 57-8).

ii. With tardus final.
(ΡΗ t), as:
‘meum ligavit arbitrium ' (iv (iii). 33—4).
‘iura tutanda imperii ⁹ (vii. 51).
(υ-Ι-ὒ), as:
⁴ gaudium expectatum videbimus ' (v. 8-9).
⁴ iterum iam punita barbaries ' (vi. 169).

whole sentence, there are certain places at which it becomes more
manifest. These are the pauses . . . at the end of the κόμμα (Lat.
incisum), of the κῶλον (Lat. membrum), and of the nep10605,(1.at.
ambitus, δια). At each pause the speaker punctuates by a rhythm.
There is thus a close connexion between rhythm and the articula·
tion of the sentence. . . . Quintilian uses clausula of the κῶλα as
well as of the period. We are wont to use the word of the period
only. There is no reason why it should not be extended to the
smaller divisions of the sentence. If so, we may speak of the
clausula of the period, the clausula of the κῶλον, and the clausula
of the κόμμα. . . . The difference between these clausulae is one of
quantity, not of kind. . . . The end of the sentence is the place for
tune3 in the κῶλα discordant notes are permissible. It follows
that in the κόμματα the measure will be harsher still. Zielinski
puts the point well when he compares the final numeri to ⁴⁴ cream '’‚
those of the major divisions in the sentence to the ordinary

(⁴⁴ mig—’1131' commerce, and those of the minor to ‘⁴ skimmed milk ‘² ⁹
