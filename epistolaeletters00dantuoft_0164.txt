102 LETTERS OF DANTE

long, in that, long since victor in the valley 01 Po, thou
dost abandon, pass by, and neglect Tuscany, not otherwise
than as if thou didst suppose the imperial rights entrusted
to thy guardianship to be limited by the boundaries of
Liguria; forgetting in sooth, as we apprehend, that the
glorious dominion of the Romans is confined neither by
the 1101111918 01 Italy, nor by the coast-line of three-

Augustus that the tyrant of Tuscany is encouraged by the
assurance that he is delaying, and daily by appealing to the
pride of the evil-doers gathers fresh strength, heaping
daring upon daring. Let the voice of Curio to Caesar be
heard once again: ‘While the factions are in confusion
and without support, away with delay ! delay was ever the
bane of the ready—equal 1011 and fear are more dearly
