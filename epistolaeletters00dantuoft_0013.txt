PREFACE vii

It has not been thought necessary toreprint here the
diplomatic transcripte, of the MS. textS, nor the collations
„ of the printed editions of the Epistolae in the above-men-
* tioned articles in the Modern Lanyuaqe Review. The
’ present text is provided with an apparatus criticus in
ἲ which are registered the divergences of this text from the
readings of the MSS„ and from those of the text of the
Ooeford Dante (as representing the ‘standard ' printed text).
Prefixed to each letter is a brief account of the MSS. in
which it has been preserved, and of the printed editions

's and translations, together with discussions of the authen-

*31 ticity and date, and a summary of contentS. Each letter

[33 is accompanied by notes, and by an English translation.¹
In illustration of the historical allusions a Ohronological
Table, from the date of Dante’s Priorate (1300) to that of

his death (1321), is provided in the Appendices ; ² in which

'1 will also be found an article on ‘Dante and the Cursus ⁹,

containing an examination of Dante’s‘ Latin (prose) works
in general, and of the Epistolae in particular, from the

, point of view of the cursus.³

¹ I have availed myself, with due acknowledgement‚ of the notes
of previous editors. In my translation I have bon-owed an
occasional word or term from the renderings of Latham (in his
Transzation os Dame’s Eleven Leuers, Boston, U.S.A.‚ 1891) and of
’ Wicksteed (in 'J'ranslation ⁰f the Latin Works of Dante Aliqhieri, London,
1904); and I have consulted on occasion the Italian version os
Fraticelli (printed in his edition of the opere Minori di Dante Aliyhieri,
Firenze, 1857), and the German of Kannegiesser (in Dante Aliyhieri’s
prosaische Schriften mit Ausuahme der Vita Nuova, Leipzig, 1845). The
Battifolle letters are now translated into English for the first time.
