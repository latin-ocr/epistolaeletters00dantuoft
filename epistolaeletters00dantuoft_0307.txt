APPENDIX C 245

remarkable in the case of Dante, who with regard to the
rhymes of the Divina Commedia is reported to have
boasted that ‘never a rhyme had led him to say other
than he would, but that many a time and oft he had
made words say in his rhymes what they were not wont
to express for other writers ' ‚1

The passage in question is in Epist. vi. 135 ff.‚ where
Dante reminds the rebellious Florentines of the fate of
Milan and Spoleto at the hands of Barbarossa: ‘Sed
recensete fulmina Federici prioris; et Mediolanum con-
sulite pariter et Spoletum ; quoniam ipsorum perversione
simul et eversione discussa viscera vestra nimium dilatata
frigescent, et corda vestra nimium ferventia contrahentur ⁹.
When first revising the text of this letter, before Ι had
taken the cursus into consideration, I was inclined to
think that the two verbs ‘frigescent ' and ‘ contrahentur '
must have accidentally got misplaced, and I was tempted
to suggest that they should be transposed, a suggestion
which Ι found later had also occurred to Giuliani. But
when I came to examine the passage afresh from the
point of view of the cursus I was soon convinced that
in the textus receptus we have what Dante wrote. The
suggested transposition (‘ dilatata contrahentur ’ and ⁴ fer-
ventia frigescent ³) would involve a double violation of
the carsae, which is strictly observed in the text as it
standS‚ ‘dilatata frigescent ’ giving a planuS, and ‘ ferventia
contrahentur ' ending the period with the conventional
velox, the fifth in a sequence of six.2 It would appear,
therefore, that on this occasion Dante was driven to
sacrifice propriety in order to meet the exigencies of the
cursus.3

says: ‘Io scrittore udii dire a Dante, che mai rima nol trasse
a dire altro che quello ch’ avea in suo proponiment0; ma ch' elli
molte e spesse volte facea li vocaboli dire nelle sue rime altro che
quello, ch' erano appo gli altri dicitori usati di sprimere ’.
