IN TRODUCTION xxxiii

To the Magnificent Megger Guido da Polenta, Lord of
venna.

Anything in the world should Ι sooner have expected
to see, rather than what I have actually in person seen
and experienced of the character of this exalted govern-
ment. Το quote the words of virgil: ‘ Minuit praesentia
famam.'¹ I had imagined to myself that Ι should here
find those noble and magnanimous Catos, those severe
censors of depraved morals, in short everything which
this people, in their most pompous and pretentious
fashion, would have unhappy and afflicted Italy believe
that they themselves specially represent. Do they not
style themselves ‘rerum dominos gentemque togatam ⁹? ²

perpetrators of injustice and corruption l

But what am I to say to you of the dense and bestial
ignorance of these grave and reverend signiors ⁶? On
coming into the presence of so ripe and venerable

ᾗ, your ambassador in that tongue, which along with the
imperial power of fair Ausonia is daily declining, and is
ever destined to decline; hoping perchance to find it
throned in its majesty in this distant corner, hereafter to
be spread abroad with the power of this state throughout
, the length and breadth of Europe, at the least. But alas!
Ι could not have appeared more of a stranger and foreigner
'had I but just arrived from remotest Thule in the west.
Nay, I should have been more likely to find an interpreter
of my unknown tongue, if I had come to them from the
fabled Antipodes, than to be listened to here with the
eloquence of Rome upon my lips. For no sooner had
I pronounced a few words of the exordium, which Ι had
prepared in your name in felicitation of the recent
election of this most serene Doge, namely : ‘Lux orta est
