Cursus Tardus

The normal form of the cursus tardus (t) consists of
a proparoxytone tetrasyllable (or its equivalent)‚ preceded
by a paroxytone dissyllable or polysyllable, the >caesura
faHing after the second syllable of the clausula, as in the
planu33 as, esse Ι videbitis ; vincla Ι perfregerat3 (oper)ari Ι
iustitiam. The final tetrasyllable may be represented
either by a paroxytone trisyllable followed by a mono-
syllable; aS, nobis Ι aggressus est; (sub)1're Ι necesse est3
or by a proparoxytone trisyllable preceded by a mono·
syllable3 as, verba Ι non caperent3 (murmu)rantes Ι in
invicem.

By the substitution, as in the planus, of two unaccented
syllables for one after the caesura, we get a secondary
form of the tardus (ι’), of the type esse Ι videamini3
(vir)tutis Ι operatio.²

What by some is classed as a variety of the cursus
tardus (θ’), and by others is placed in the category of the
cursus medius? has the caesura after the third syllable of
the clausula, which thus consists of a proparoxytone tri-
syllable preceded by a proparoxytone trisyllable or poly-
syllable; as, ingiter Ι postulat ; (pechutitur Ι impius.

Cursus Velox.

The cursus velox in its normal form (v) consists of
a paroxytone tetrasyllable (or its equivalent) preceded by
a proparoxytone trisyllable or polysyllable, the caesura
falling after the third syllable of the clausula3 as, om-
nia lvideantur3 vinculum Ι fregeramus3 (su)surrio{blan·
dientem.⁴ The final tetrasyllable may be represented

the help of minor accents’ (see Clark, op. cit„ p. 10).
