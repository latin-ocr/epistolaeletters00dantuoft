xxxii LETTERS OF DAN TE

the first >actual text of a letter of Dante was given to
the world. This was in 1547, in which year was
published in Florence a slim quarto of eighty pages,
now exceedingly rare, entitled Prose Antiche di Dante,
Petrarcha et Boccaccz'O, ct di molti altri Nobili ct Virtuosi
Iwyeyni, mcovamentc raccolte. The first piece in this
volume, of which the editor, as well as printer, was the
eccentric Anton Francesco Doni, is ‘Pistola di Dante
Alighieri Poeta Fiorentino all' Imperator' Arrigo di
Luzimborgo’, and is in fact an Italian translation, in¹
a very corrupt and mutilated text, of Dante's letter to the
Emperor Henry VII, the Latin original of which, as we
have seen, was known to Villani, Boccaccio‚ and Bruni.
The last piece but one in the volume is a letter in Italian
‘Al Magnifico Messer Guido da Polenta, Signor da Ra-
venna ’, dated from Venice, March 30, 1314, and signed
‘L' umil servo vostro Dante Alighieri Fiorentino ⁹.

No indication 18 given by Doni as to the source from
which these two letters were derived. As regards the
genuineness of the Italian translation of the letter to
Henry VII there can be no manner of doubt, inasmuch as
numerous MSS. of it are in existence, and it more or less
closely corresponds with the Latin text as we now have
it. The letter to Guido da Polenta, however, stands on
a very different footing. Not only has no MS. of this
letter ever been heard of, but it bears on the face of it
indubitable proofs of its falsity. The letter, which pur-
ports to be an account of Dante’s experiences as envoy of
Guido da Polenta to the Venetian Republic to offer con-
gratulations on the recent election of a new Doge, runs
as follows :¹
