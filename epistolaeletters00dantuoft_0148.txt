the letters attributed 10 Dante which is specifically dated, the
colophon giving the date as April 17, 1311.⁴

SUMMARY.—§ 1. The legacy of peace was left 10 mankind by
Christ, but the envy of the devil has brought strife upon 1113

world. In Italy those who have long mourned in exile look to
the advent of the Emperor 10 restore peace. §2 But their
eager hopes 313 (133113(1 by doubts 33 to whether he is actually
coming—nevertheless their belief in him 33 111311 appointed
saviour is unshaken. ξ 3. Let the Emperor not consider
Tuscany outside his sphere of acti0n3 let him remember that
the Imperial power 13 not circumscribed save by the waters of
Ocean; and let him think on the divine origin of the Roman
Empire. §4. Let him put an end, then, to delay‚ which only
encourages his enemies, and let him call to mind the exhorta-
tions of Curio to Caesar, and of Mercuiy to Aeneas. §5. Let
him not forget the interests of his son, that second Ascanius 3
and let him beware lest he incur the reproach of Samuel against
Saul. §6. Like Hercules in his combat with the hydra, he is
making the mistake 01 attacking the separate heads, by attempt-
ing to chastise Milan, Cremona, and the rest, instead of striking
at once at the 3331 of life. A tree is not destroyed by lopping
off branches; it 13 1113 1001 which must be extirpated. ξ 7. The
real seat of mischief is not on Po, nor 011 Τ11031, 10111 011 Α1110;
11 13 Florence, who 1113-3313111181 Rome is-striving to rend her, own
mother3 Florence it is that is the centre‘ of corruption. But
written two days before the Emperor left Milan in order to reduce

Cremona (333 ΟΙινοηοῑορίοαΖ Table).
