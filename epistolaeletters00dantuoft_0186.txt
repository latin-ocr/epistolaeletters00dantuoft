DA'rE.—After the death of the Gascon Pope Clement V (ί il
Guasco '‚ Par. xvii. 82), at Roquemaure on the Rhone‚ on April
20, 1314, the Cardinals to the number of twenty-four assembled
in Conclave at Carpentras, about sixteen miles from Avignon,
to elect a successor. Of these, six only were Italian, namely
Niccolo da Prato, Napoleone Orsini, Guglielmo de' Longhi‚
Francesco Gaetani, and Jacopo and Pietro Colonna; the rest
being French, for the most part Gascons devoted to the interests
represented hythe late Pope. The Italian Cardinals fixed their
hopes on a candidate, an Italian Bishop, though a Frenchman
(Guillaume de Mandagot‚ Cardinal-Bishop of Palestrina)‚ who
should restore the Papal See to Rome, and should rescue the
Papacy from the predominating French‚ and especially Gascon,
influence. The Gascon party, fearing that if the Bishop of
Palestrina were elected their plans would be defeated, on J uly
14, with Bertrand de Got, the late Pope's nephew, at their head,
burst into the Conclave‚ with arms in their hands, and, shouting
‘Death to the Italian Cardinals’‚ drove them out and forced
them to take refuge at Valence.² The Conclave being thus

illam erigere, quae non nisi forsan suprema dispensatione sic
trahitur, et quod dispensatorie agitur, tenere tu repenses? an
putas, ovis una, totum romanum gregem plus suo pastore diligere
. . .‘?' with ll. 67-72 of Dante's letter. Rienzi speaks of the
‘ romanum ovile’ (cf. l. 22); of the ‘sacrilegii‚ scismatis haeresis-
que commaculae ’ (cf. 11. 30-2) ; of the ‘ praecipitium’ into which
the people are being led (cf. 11. 48-9); of ‘civitatem sanctam,
evacuatam, . . . desolatam' (cf. ll. 144-5); of ‘piissima lnater‘
(cf. l. 107), &c

² An account of this outrage was given by the Italian Cardinals
themselves in au encyclical letter dated from Valence on Sept. 8
of the same year, within a few weeks of the event : ‘Venerabilibus
in Christo Patribus religiosis viris fratribus Cisterciensi[bus]‚ de
Firmitate, de Pontiniaco, de claravalle, et de Morimundo monasterio-
