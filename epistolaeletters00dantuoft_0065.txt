EPISTOLA I 3

whole party of the Bianchi of Florence, is not ascribed to ,

Dante by name in the MS„ but it was evidently, like the
three Battifolle letters, considered by the compiler1 of the

'collection to have been written by Dante ; and this attribution
is commonly accepted.2

Dum—The Cardinal da Prato (Niccolo degli Albertini)‚
Bishop of Ostia and Velletri, who had been appointed by
Benedict XI ‘pacificator in Tuscany, Romagna, the March
of Treviso‚ and the parts adjacent' on Jan. 31, 1304 ⁸, arrived
in Florence in this capacity on March 10 following ⁴, and it is
probable that this letter was addressed to him by Dante from
Arezzo on behalf of the exiled Florentines either shortly
before⁵ or shortly after⁶ his arrival in that city—at any rate
in the spring or early summer of 1304, before his final de-

ment from Florence Dante decided to make common cause with
the other Florentino exiles, who fixed their headquarters at
Arezzo, where they remained until 1304: ‘finalmente fermarono
la sedia loro ad Arezzo, e quivi ferono campo grosso e crearono loro
capitano il conte Alessandro da Romena ; feron dodici consiglieri,
del numero dei quali fu Dante ε 0 (11 speranza in speranza stettero

infino all’ anno milletrecento quattro ’. Β1ι1111 makes the same ’

statement 111 his Historia Florentina (see Zenatti's Dante e Pinnae,

' p. 363, where the passage is quoted).

1 The original compiler of the collection was probably Boccaccio
(see Zenatti, ορ. cit„ pp. 458-93 and Bulletti‘no della Societc't Dantesea
Italiam, N.S. x. 139).

² Not, however, by Del Lungo—see his Dino Gompaqni 0 la sua
cronica, vol. ii, pp. 585-963 and see below, p. 4, 11. 2.

in the previous year ; he took part in the coronation of Henry VII
at Rome on June 29, 1312 (villani, ix. 43 3 Dino Compagni, iii. 36) ;
and was one of the Colonnesi pa‘rty at Carpentras in 1314 (see note
on date of Epist. viii) ; he died at Avignon on April 1, 1321, a few
months before Dante.
