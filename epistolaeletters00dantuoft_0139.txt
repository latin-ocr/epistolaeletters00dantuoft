EPISTOLA VI ’7 ’7

TRANSLATION

Dante Aliyhieri, a Florentinc undescrveclly in emilc, to tlzc ’
most iniquitous Florentino-3 within the city.

, ξ 1. The gracious providence of the Eternal King, who in
’ his goodness ever rules the affairs of the world above, yet
ceases not to look down upon our concerns here below,
committed to the Holy Roman Empire the governance of
human affairs, to the end that mankind might repose in
the peace of so powerful a protection, and everywhere, as
nature demands, might live as citizens of an ordered
world. And though the proof of this is to be found in
holy writ, and though the ancients relying on reason alone
bear witness thereto, yet is it no small confirmation of the
truth, that when the throne of Augustus is vacant, the
whole world goes out of course, the helmsman and rowers
slumber in the ship of Peter, and unhappy Italy, forsaken
and abandoned to private control, and bereft of all public
guidance, is tossed with such buffeting of winds and waves
as no words can describe, nay as even the Italians in their
woe can scarce measure with their ᾕρει-εὴ( Wherefore let
all who in mad presumption have risen up against this
most manifest will of God, now grow pale at the thought
of the judgement of the stern J udge, which is nigh at hand,
if so be the sword of Him who saith, ‘Vengeance is mine '‚
be not fallen out of heaven. γ

§ 2. §But you, who transgress every law of God and man,
and whom the insatiable greed of avarice has urged all too
willing into every crime, does the dread of the second
death not haunt you, seeing that you first and you alone,
shrinking from the yoke of liberty, have murmured
against the glory of the Roman Emperor, the king of the
earth, and minister of Grod ; and under cover of prescrip-
tive right, refusing the duty of submission due to him,
have chosen rather to rise up in the madness of rebellion *ΡΥ
Have you to learn, senseless and perverse1 as you are,
that public right can be subject to no reckoning by
