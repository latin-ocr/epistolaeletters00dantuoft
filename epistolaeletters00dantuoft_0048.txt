xlii - LETTERS OF DANTE

tion in the poem may the more easily be comprehended
from the observations to which he himself gave expression
in the following form.1 ’

This preface, which occurs in four of the six known

MSS.,² was reprinted by the eighteenth-century editorS‚ ·

but it has been discarded by the more recent editors of the
letters of Dante.

The text of the letter as printed in the Galleria di
Minerva was full ‚of blunderS‚ due either to the original
scribe or to the copyist of the Lanzoni MS. 3 and in this
corrupt form it continued to be reproduced for more than
a hundred years. It may be ,mentioned that a collation
with this text of the passages recorded above as having
been quoted by Gelli and Borghini shows that the latter
were not derived from the same MS. as the Baruffaldi
text.

Later in this century we get the first accession to the
list of letters hitherto recorded. This consists of the
letter to the Princes and Peoples of Italy (Epist. v), in
an Italian version, Which was printed in a collection of
letters of the eleventh, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth
centuries‚ published at Rome in 1754 by Pietro Lazzari

1 ‘Praefari aliqua in initio cuiusque operis sui antiquitas con· ·
suevit, quae quanto pauciora fuerint, tanto ocius ad rem, de qua
agitur, aditus fiet, praesertim cui curae non erit exquisita, et
accurata locutio, quae docentibus eloquentiam convenit. Expediam
igitur illico, ne dum studeo devitare prolixitatem, in illam ipsam
incurrerim. Satis igitur mihi erit in loco, vice prohemii fore con-
sultum, si quae Poeta rescribens Domino Cani, cui hanc canticam
tertiam dedicavit, pro ipsa praefatione indiderim: quo melius
Poetae intentio ab eiusdem observationibus intelligatur3 quae sub
hac forma fuere. . . . ⁷
