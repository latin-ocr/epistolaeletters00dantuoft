AUTHENTIGITY.—These three letters are not assigned to
Dante by name in the MS„ but, as in the case of Epist. i‚¹
from their position among acknowledged letters of Dante they
were evidently regarded by the original coinpiler of the
collection contained in the MS. (who is supposed to have been
Boccaccio) 2 as having been written by Dante. The question as
to their attribution to Dante was examined recently in great
detail by Dr. Moore in an article in the Modern Lanyuaye
Review,³ which was reprinted, with additions and corrections,
in the fourth volume of his Studies in Dante‚⁴ the conclusion
being strongly in favour of their Dantesque authorship.5
Dante is known to have been in the Casentino, and in all
probability at the Castle of Poppi (whence the third letter is
dated) at about the time the letters were written!3 The
Countess, in whose name they are written, being herself
incapable of composing a letter in Latin to the Empress
according to the recognized epistolary formulae (including the
observance of the cursus), Dante, in view of his relations with
the Emperor,⁷ was the natural person to be employed as
seoretaryss for the purpose. 'I'he striking correspondence of

⁶ See the colophons of his letters to the Florentines (Epist. vi)
and to the Emperor (Epist. vii), and notes.

'² His letter to the Emperor was written (April 17, 1311) just
a month before the date <May 18) of the last of the three letters
to the Empress.

⁸ We know from Flavio Biondo that Dante had acted not long
before as secretary to Scarpetta Ordelaffi at Forli (sce Introduction).
