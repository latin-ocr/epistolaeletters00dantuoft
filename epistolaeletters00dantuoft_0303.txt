composed of two members, of which there are five types,
are naturally far more numerous than those of the second,
composed of three memberS. The type which occurs
most frequently in the Ehoistolae is (ί-Ι-υ), of which I have
noted 77 instances ; next comes (va-ppt), with 73 instances3
then (pl÷t),with 49; (v-l-t), with 483 and ( pl 4102), with
36. Of the eight types comprised in the second class
none occurs more than half a dozen times, nor less than
twice, · that of most frequent occurrence being (pl 'l’ffl -ι- t),
that of the least f1 equent (v÷pl÷ t).

If the cursus medius (m), and secondary forms, be taken
into consideration the number of types will be very
largely increased. Of two· member clausulae of this
description I have noted among those of most siequent
occurrence (m-l-v) and (p124pl)‚ with upwards of 50
instances each3 and (pl‘2-1—t), with upwards of 30.
Examples of the first (m-l-v) are: ‘nymphis aliis dere-
lictis' (iii (iv). 46-7); ‘ Palilus gentium praedicator ³·(viii.
25); of the second (ΙΨ-ηὼς ‘pacis amatores et iusti’
(i. 55); ‘fluctus Amphitritis attingens' (vii. 58-9); and
of the third (ΙΨ-μέμ ‘pium deserentes imperium' (vi.
50-1); ‘regem aspernata legitimum' (vii. 167-8).

Of three-member clausulae of the same description the
most frequent is (pl4 -1- pl2÷ pl), with eight instances, as:
‘ maria quondam transvolando despexit' (vi. 84-5); ‘Tiberi
tuo criminosa potatur' (vii. 139-40); next come, with seven
instances each, (v -1- pl2 ÷ pl), as: ‘ (spon)tanea et sincera
voluntate subimus ⁹ (i. 56—7) ; ‘ (sine) omnium detrimento
interire non potest' (vi. 45-6) ; and (m ÷ v 4190, as:
‘ultra medium praemiando se figit' (v. 41-2); ‘vestris
animis infigenda supersunt’ (vi. 179); then, with five
instances each, (pl4 ÷ pl ÷ t), as: ‘liberum meum ligavit
arbitrium’ (iv (iii). 33); ‘fulguris instar descendens affuerit’
(v. 53-4) ; (p14pz24t)‚ as: ‘ absit a viro praedicante
iustitiam' (ix. 36-7); ‘etsi divinis comprobatur elogiis ' (vi.
8-9) ; (m ÷ v -1- t), as: ‘ (se)veri iudicis adventante iudicio ’
(vi. 24) 3 ‘mentis aciem penetrando dulcescerent’ (vii*. 3-4);
and (pl—1· m -f-v), as: ‘velut a patre filiis ministrantur'
(iii (iv). 54-5) ; ⁴ coeli et terrae Dominus ordinavit ⁹(v. 164-5).1
