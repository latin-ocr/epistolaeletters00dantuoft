x LETTERS OF DANTE

well as to other members of the Oxford Dante Society,
among whom should specially be mentioned Professor
W. P. Ker of All Souls, the Dean of Christ Ghurch

(Dr. Strong), and the Rev. F. E. Brightman of Magdalen;
also to the late Dr. Bannister‚ formerly of Rome, for his

kind offices in procuring photographic reproductions of
the Vatican and S. Pantaleo MSS. of the Epistolae, and

to Mr. Horatio F. Brown‚ of Venice, for similar services
with regard to the Marcian MS.

I am glad to take this opportunity of acknowledging
my indebtedness to the Press readers, to whose vigilance

is due the detection of sundry errors and misprints which

had escaped my notice.

superior impressit, hoc mamime interesse videtur, ut

quemadmodum de labore antiquorum ditati suut, ita et

habeat quo ditetur!
