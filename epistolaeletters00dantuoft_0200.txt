¹ ‘If Rome did not exist, you as Cardinals would have no
existence! It is difficult to believe that Dante can have written
such a sentence as the MS. reading here (⁴ cum sit uobis principium
ciuilitatis esse ipsu'm quoque ⁹), which is moreover impossible from
the point of view of the cursus, It is no doubt a case of ‘pie '‚ as
to which see Moore, Studies in Dante, iv. 6, 33. Moore shows how
easily a confused sentence like the above may arise—words acci-
dentally omitted by a primitive copyist, and by him (or another)
written in the margin, subsequently get inserted in the text, but
in the wrong place. 'The process is analogous to that by which
marginal glosses become embodied in the text. The omission of

’ civilitatis (which apparently was caught by the copyist from the
preceding line), and the substitution of ipsius for ipsum, are due to
Witte. It may be noted that the phrase ipsius esse, in the genitive,
occurs in Epist. x. 398.

² The genitive eclipseos, which is substituted for the MS. reading
eclipsis by all the editors except Muzzi‚ is non-existent in Latin.
The regular genitive both in late and in mediaeval Latin was
eclipsis, which is the only form registered by Giovanni da Genova,
whereas he gives the alternative genitives stis vel -eos’ for other
words of Greek origin in -is; e. g. yenesis, - heresis, metamorphosis,
syntaxis.

3 For the MS. reading of this sentence, ‘qui οεῆῑι insolite sui uel
solis eclipsis οῦ fuistis ', which makes no sense, Ο. following Witte
reads ‘qui causa insolitae sui vel solis eclipseos fuistis ⁹. I think
it more probable that οᾶῖνῖ is⁴a mistake, not for σᾶ (i.e. causa), but
for tei-ni (c and t being very easily confounded in MSS), i. e. tantum,
in the sense ostam (cf. Epist. ix. 33: ‘temeraria tantum ’ 3 and see
Du Gange, s.v., where he quotes ‘tantum lividum’ as an instance
of ‘tantum pro tam’); and that the meaningless cti (i. e. cum) of
