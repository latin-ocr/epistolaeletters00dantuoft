THE HISTORY OF THE LETTERS OF DANTE
FROM THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY ΤΟ THE
PRESENT DAY¹

ΤΗΑΤ Dante was the author of numerous letters, some
of which were in the nature of political manifestoes,
while others were more or less concerned with his own

· personal interests‚ we know from various sources.

In the first place we have Dante’s own testimony in
the Vita Naeva, where he refers (§ 31) to a letter which
he says he addressed to the principal personages of the
city of Florence after the death of Beatrice, which took
place on the evening of June 8, 1290.2 He quotes the
beginning of this letter (⁴ Quomodo sedet sola civitas 2³)‚³
but excuses himself for not transcribing more than the
opening words on the ground that the letter was in Latin,
and it was not his intention to include in the Vita Nuova
anything that was not written in the vulgar tongue.⁴

⁸ This letter, of which no other trace has been preserved, is not
to be confounded, as it has been by some, with another letter of
Dante, that addressed to the Italian Cardinals (Epist. viii), which
begins with the same quotation from Lamentations (i. 1).

rimase tutta la cittade quasi vedova, dispogliata di ogni dignitade,
