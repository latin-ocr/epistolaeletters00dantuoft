¹ cf. Ins. xv. 61—2: ‘Quell’ ingrato popolo maligno, Che diseese
di Fiesole ab antieo'3 and 1. 73: ‘le bestie Fiesolane’, i.e. the
Florentines. According to the Florentino tradition, Fiesole, after
being besieged by Julius Caesar for nearly nine years, was destroyed
by the Romans, who then founded Florence, which was peopled
with a mixture of Romans and Fiesolans (cf. villani, i. 31-8).

2 The Punica of the Oxford text is due to a misreading of the MS.
by the original transcriber. The correction is due in the first
place to W. Meyer (see his Fraymenta Βῑιναηα, Berlin, 1901, pp. 156-7),
who suspected Punica, not only on account of the doubtful Latinity
of the phrase ‘iterum iam Punica barbaries’‚ but also as violating
the cursus, which is restored—‘ (pu)nita barbaries ' (tardus)-by the
correction. There is no doubt as to the MS. reading. Dante here
threatens the Florentines with the destruction of their city a second
time, the first having been, as he and his contemporaries believed,
at the hands of Attila (cf. Ins. xiii. 148-9), or 'I'otila (cf. villani,
ii. 1 ; iii. 1). (See Moore, Studies in Dante, iv. 280-1.) As a matter
of fact there appears to be no truth in the tradition (which doubt-
less arose from a confusion of Attila with Totfla, King of the
Ostrogoths, by whose forces Florence was besieged in 542) that ’
Florenee was destroyed either by Attila or Totila.

³ Cf. 2 Cor. vii. 9-10.Δ ⁴ Cf. Par. vi. 73.

5 All the editors punctuate ‘ baiulus hic, divus' ; but the cursus—
ι(Βοῐηὶιῃειθ) rei baiulus’ (m)—shows that hic belongs to the next
clause, as indeed all the Italian editors recognize in their transla-
tion, which is in contradiction with their text.
