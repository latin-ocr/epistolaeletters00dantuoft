EPISTOLA VII 101

heritage of peace was left to us, that in its wondrous
‘ sweetness the hardships of our warfare might be softened‚
and that by its practice we might earn the joys of the
triumphant Fatherland. But the envy of the ancient and
implacable enemy, who ever secretly plots against the
prosperity of mankind, having dispossessed some of their
own free will, has, owing to the absence of our guardian,
impiously stripped us others against our will. Wherefore
we have long wept by the waters of Confusion, and un-
ceasingly prayed for the protection of the just king, who

declaring thee to be the minister of God, the son of the
Ohurch‚ and the furtherer of the glory of Rome] For I too,
who write as well for myself as for others, beheld thee most
gracious, and heard thee most clement, as beseems Imperial
Majesty, when my hands touched thy feet, and my lips
paid their tribute. Then my spirit rejoiced within me,
when I said secretly within myself : ⁴ Behold the Lamb of
God, which taketh away the sins of the‘ world '.
