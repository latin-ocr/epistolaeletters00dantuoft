EPISTOLA VI 65

non potuit, quin spe plenus epistolam quamdam ad Florentinos,
ut ipse vocat intrinsecos contumeliosam sane scriberet, in qua
eos acerbissime insectatum quum ante hac de ipsis honorificen-
tissime loqui solitus esset '——-a statement which contains an un-
mistakable reference to the title of the letter (scelestissimis
Florentinis intrinsecis '). But Manetti is here simply echoing
a passage in Bruni's Historia Florentina : ‘ Extat Dantis poetae
epistola amarissimis referta contumeliis, quam ipse inani fiducia
exultans, contra Florentinos, ut ipse vocat, intrinsecos scripsit3
et quos ante id tempus honorificentissimis compellare solebat
verbis, tunc huius (i.e. of the Emperor) spe supra modum
elatus, acerbissime insectari non dubitat’ (ed. 1610, p. 88). It
may be noted, further, that Manetti states that the letter, which
is dated March 31, 1311, was written at the time of the siege of
Florence, which did not begin till the autumn of 1312. (See

Modern Lanyuaye Review, xiv. 111—12).

DA'rE.—This is one of three among the letters attributed to
Dante which is specifically dated, the other two being the letter
to the Emperor (Epist. vii), and the last Battifolle letter (Epist.
vii***). In all three, while the day of the month (in this case
March 31) is indicated 111 the usual manner by means of the
Roman Calendar the year is given as the first year of a new era

namely that of the advent of the Emperor into Italy—‘ faustis-

mi cursus ⁷Henrici Caesaris¹ ad. Italiam anno Ρ11111ὅ’ (1. e.

1311).
