EPISTOLA VIII

(‘ Quomodo sola sedet civitas ’)

To THE ITALIAN CARDINALS

[May or June, 1314]

Mss—Tffls letter, like those to a Pistojan Exile (Epist. iii
(iv))‚ and to a Friend in Florence (Epist. ix), has been preserved
(unfortunately in a very corrupt textl) only in the Laurentian
MS. (Cod. xxix. 8) already mentioned,² the portion of which
containing these three letters is in the handwriting of Boccaccio‚
and was executed probably about the year 1348.

¹ Consequently editors of the letter have indulged pretty freely
in conjectural emendations. Ι have been able to restore the MS.
reading in a considerable number of passages ; but, as will be seen,
I have myself introduced a certain number of conjectural emenda-
tions, for some of which, as well as for many valuable criticisms
and suggestions, Ι am indebted to my friend the Principal of
Brasenose (Dr. Heberden).
