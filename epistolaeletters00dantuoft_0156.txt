¹ Egyptian god identified by the Romans with Mercury, who is
the personage quoted as addressing Aeneas in the text. This
identification was currently known and accepted in the Middle
Ages. Dante’s authority was probably either Servius on Aen.
viii. 698: ‘Latrator Anubis, quia capite canino pingitur; hunc
volunt esse Mercurium, ideo quia nihil est cane sagacius'3 or
Uguccione da Pisa, who in his Maqnae Derivatiorzes (a work well
known to Dante) sayse' ‘Anubis. Nubes componitur cum a, quod
est sine3 et dicitur hic anubis, id est mercurius, quasi sine rmbe3 est
enim deus sermonis quia omnia revelat '. There can be no doubt

as to the correctness of the reading Anubis as against the α nubibus ·

of Ρ.1 and Ο. (See my article ‘Anubis' or ‘a nubibus’ in Dante's letter
to Henry VII, in Bulletirz Italian, xii. 1-5.) ² Aen. iv. 272-6.

³ John of Luxemburg (born 1295), at this time iu his sixteenth
year, was King of Bohemia (1310) in right of his marriage with
Elizabeth‚ daughter of Wenceslas IV (Vill. ix. 1). He had been
crowned at Prague in the previous February. Having lost both
his eyes he was subsequently known as the ‘Blind King of
Bohemia'. He was killed at the battle of Crecy in 1346. Accord-
ing to the (unauthenticated) tradition, the badge of three ostrich
feathers‚ with the motto Ich dien, borne by the Prince of WaIes,
originally belonged to King John, and was assumed by the Black
Prince after the king's death at Crecy.

⁴ He never succeeded to the Empire.
