Lazzari states that the MS. in which the letter occurs
contained also the Italian version 01 Dante's letter to the
Emperor, as well as Marsilio Ficino’s translation of the
De Monarchia, extracts from the Vita Nuova, and Bruni's
lives of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. He remarks
that the text of the letter to the Emperor differs to some
extent from that printed by Β1ε1610111,2 from which 116

, concludes, rightly as we now know, that both that letter

and the one he now prints for the first time were
originally written in Latin.

variants from a MS., at that time in the Cocchi collection,

Can Grande3 and two years later (1790) 116 printed'for
1116 first time, in the fifth volume of the same series, the
Latin text 01 yet another letter of Dante, namely, the
letter 10 6 Florentino friend.4 This letter was discovered
