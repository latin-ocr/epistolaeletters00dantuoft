32 LETTERS OF DANTE

letter, accompanied by a canzone,¹ describing how the writer
had been overcome by a tempestuous passion for a lady he had
met in the valley of the Arno, was written, apparently from

the casentino, after Dante's departure from Lunigiana, perhaps
in 1308, but at any rate before 1310.2

ADDRESSEE.—At the time the letter was written there were
several members of the Malaspina family who bore the name
of Moroello³; but Dante's correspondent is usually identified
with Moroello III, the Guelf captain, ‘il vapor di Valdimagra’
of Ins. xxiv. 145, the son of Manfredi da Giovagallo (d. 1282)
of the ‘Spino Secco’ branch of the family. This Moroello
was first cousin of Currado II (Pury. viii. 65, 118) and of ’
Franceschino‚ Dante’s host at Sarzana in 1307,4 and grandson
of Currado I (Pury. viii. 119).5 Ηο married Alagia de’ Fieschi,
niece of Pope Adrian V (Pur-9. xix. 142), and died about the
year 1315.ὅ Boccaccio, in his Vita di Dante,⁷ relates that it
was while under Moroello's roof in Lunigiana⁸ that Dante was
induced to continue the Commedia, the composition of which
had been interrupted by his exile from Florence; he further

below, pp. 36-8).

2 See Zenatti, op. cit„ pp. 450-1. Torraca, on the other hand, who
argues that the ‘curia' of l. 10 of the letter was that of the
Emperor Henry VII, not that of the Malaspini‚ holds that the
letter was written in 1311 (see Bul-l. Soc. Dant. Ital„ N.S. X. 147).

8 Filippo Villani also records Dante's visit to Moroello, and
states in so many words that on leaving him Dante betook himself
to the Gasentino (whence this letter is supposed to have been
written, see above) :—‘ A Moruello . . . decedens, Casentinum
applicuit‘ (Expositio super comedia Dantis, ξ 3, ed. Cugnoni).
