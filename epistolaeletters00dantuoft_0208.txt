146 LETTERS OF DANTE

rebuke and admonishment from so lowly a source, and
not from Heaven, which may pardon you, In the right
ι fashion indeed are we dealt with when we are smitten on
’ that side by which shame can reach our hearing as well
as the rest of our senses, and beget in us repentance, her
first-born, who in turn shall give birth to purpose of
amendment.

§1st And that a glorious patience may foster and
maintain this purpose, it behoves you to keep before the
eyes of your mind, according to the measure of your
imagination, the present condition of the city of Rome,
a sight to move the pity even of Hannibal, not to say
others, bereft as she now is of the one and the other of
her luminarieS‚ and sitting solitary and widowed, as is
written above. And this most chiefly is the concern of
you who have known sacred Tiber as little children. for
although it is the duty of all Italians to love the capital
of Italy as the common source of their civility, yet is it
justly held to be your part most especially to reverence it,
since for you it is the source also of your very being>
And if at the present time misery has consumed with
grief and confounded with shame the rest of the inhabi-
tants of Italy, who can doubt but that you must blush
with shame, and must grieve, who have been the cause of
‘¹ ’ζ so unwonted an eclipse of Rome or rather of her Sun‘?
Thou above all, Orsini, that thy colleagues who have been ,
degraded should not continue for ever stripped of their
glory3 and they, that by the authority of the Apostolic
Head they should resume the venerable insignia of the
Church Militant, which, not as perchance having com·
pleted their service, but undeservedly, they were com-
pelled to lay down. 'I'hou also, the adherent of the other
Transteverine faction, in order that the wrath of the
deceased pontiff might put forth leaves in thee, like
a branch engrafted on a trunk not its own, as if thou
. hadst not yet put off the Carthage that was conquered of
old, couldst thou, without the reproof of thy better judge·
ment, prefer this purpose before the country of the
illustrious Scipios‘?
