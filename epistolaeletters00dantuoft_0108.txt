46 LETTERS OF DANTE

pre-ordination of the Roman Emperor is proved by the course
of history, a survey of which from the repulse of the Argonauts
by Laomedon down to the triumphs of Octavian will show that
certain events ‘have altogether transcendet] the highest pitch
of human effort', and that at times God has used man as the
unconscious instrument of his will. ξ 9. Further proof suppli9d

² Almus was commonly used by mediaeval writers as a synonym
of sanctus, and that is no doubt its meaning here, ‘alma urbs ³,
i. e. Rome, being the exact equivalent of ‘urbs sancta ', Mon. ii. 5,
l. 106 ; and ‘santa citta’, Gom). iv. 5, 11. 53, 179; cf. Ins. ii. 20:
‘ alma Roma', where Benvenuto da Imola comments: ‘Roma dicitur
alma urbs, idest sancta'. The word is used by Dante in a similar
sense in Epist. vi. 39-40: ‘legum sanctiones almae' (where the
⁸ textus receptus reads altissime). The expression ‘alma urbs ’, meaning
Rome, occurs repeatedly in the letters of Rienzi (Epistozario di Gela

di Bimae, ed. Gahfielli, pp. 6, 9, 12, 15, 16, 29, 87) (see Mod. Lany.
