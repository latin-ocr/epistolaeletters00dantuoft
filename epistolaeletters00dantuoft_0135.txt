Emperor, in order to hasten the reduction of the town, built
a fortress to face it which he called Victoria. One day, however,
while the Emperor was absent on a hunting expedition, the
Parmesans, rendered desperate by famine, made a sortie‚ and

ι captured and destroyed the fortress, taking at the same time an
immense booty including the Imperial crown, and forcing the
Emperor to retire to Cremona.

¹ Villani records (v. 1) how the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa
besieged and destroyed Spoleto in 1152, and Milan in 1157, the
site of the latter being ploughed and sown with salt ; cf. Pura. xviii.
119-20.

² One might be tempted at first sight to suggest that the verbs
in these two sentences have accidentally got transposed3 but the
cursus—‘(dila)tata frigescent’ (planus), ‘ (fer)ventia contrahentur⁷
(velem—proves that no such hypothesis is admissible.

3 A bold metaphor, with which may be compared ‘humana
ratio propriis pedibus ' (Mon. ii. 8, 1. 9) ; ‘spatulas iudicii' (V. E.
i. 6, 1. 22) ; and ‘piedi del coto' (Par. iii. 26-7>.

4 ‘Pennati ', i.e. those who have attained to years of discretion,
men of experience. Of. Prov. i. 17, and Pury. xxxi. 61-3: ‘Nuovo
augelletto due o tre aspetta; Ma dinanzi dagli occhi dei pennuti
Rete si spiega indarno o si saetta.’ Pistelli (Bau. Soc. Dant. Ital„
N.S. xxiv. 64) makes the plausible suggestion that the words
‘et rete frustra iaciatur' have been accidentally omitted by the
copyist, and that the sentence should read: ‘Quam in noctis
tenebris malesanae mentis pedes oberrent, et rete frustra iaciatur
ante oculos pennatorum '.
