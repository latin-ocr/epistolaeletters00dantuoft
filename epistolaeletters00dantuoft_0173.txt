EPISTULA VII* 111

behold with joy by my eyes, and with becoming reverence
was received into my handS. And when the purport
thereof penetrated the recesses of my mind with its sweet-
ness, my heart as I read glowed with so great fervour of
devotion as oblivion can never extinguish, nor memory
recall without delight. For who and what am I, that the
most potent spouse of Caesar should condescend to inform
me as to the well-being (which long may it endure Ξ) of
her Consort and of herself? Verily the weight of so great
an honour neither the deserte nor the dignity of her who
greets you could look for. Yet was it not unseemly that the
pinnacle of the ranks of human society should thus incline
itself, since from hence, as from a living sonutam, the
exemplars of sacred civilization must be transmitted to
those below. To return adequate thanks is beyond the
power of man, but I deem it to be not unnatural for man
sometimes to make prayer to God for help in his insuffi-
ciency. Now therefore let the court of the starry realm
be assailed with just and holy prayers, and may the zeal
of the suppliant obtain that the Eternal Ruler of the world
may recompense so great a condescension with propor-
tionate reward, and may stretch forth the right hand of
His grace in furtherance of the hopes of Caesar and of
Augusta 3 to the end that He, who for the safeguard of man·
kind brought under the Empire of the Roman Prince all
peoples barbarian and civilized, may by the triumphs and
glory of His servant Henry regenerato the human family
of this crazy age.
