To all and sinyular the Primos of I taly, and the Senators of
the Sacred city, as also the Dulce& Mammisea GountS, and
Peoples‘, α humble Italian, Dante Aliyhieri a Florentme
undeservc ἄζῃ in exile, prayeth peace. “”“

ξ 1. Behold now is the accepted time, wheiein arise
the signs of consolation and peace. For a new day is
beginning to break, revealing the daw 11 in the East, which
even now is dispersing the darkness of our long tribulation.
Already the orient breeze is freshening, the face of the
heavens grows rosy, and confirms the hopes of the peoples
with an auspicious calm. And we too, who have kept
vigil through the long nighss 111 the wildei 11033 shall behold
the long· awaited Joy. ¹<lifol the Sim of peace shalLappear

1 Ephes. iv. 17-18. 2 See above, p. 15, n. 4.

3 The punctuation of the Oxford text violates the ουτως-ι oculos
mentis vestrae ’ (velox)—besides obscuring the sense.

4 Cf. 1 Pet. ii. 17.

⁵ This is an unmistakable reference to Clement’s encyclical of
Sept. 1, 1310 (‘Exultat in gloria’), see above, p. 45, n. 2.

⁶ Dante here (as also in Epist. vi. 54-5) accepts the symbolism
against which he argues in the De Monarchia (iii. 4), and which he
rejects in the Commodia (cf. Pury. xvi. 107-8)‚ namely‚ that the
greater light represents the Pope, and the lesser the Emperor.
