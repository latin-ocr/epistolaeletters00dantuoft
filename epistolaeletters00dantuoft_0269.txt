eace. As to the first the proof is as follows: The con-
&mmg body stands in the same relation to the content in

natural position as the formative does to the formable, as .

we are told in the fourth book of the Ph sics- But in the ρ ‘⁴ ς’·

natural position of the whole universe iiie first heaven is

the heaven which ‘contains all things ; consequently it is

related to all‘tliih*g⁴s“*as'⁷'the formative to the formable‚

which is to be in the relation of cau'se‘t'o'effect. And since

heaven of the moon, for instance, moves because of some ' ³ ι f

part of itself which has not attained the station towards ¹

which it is moving ; and because no part whatsoever of it

has attained any terminus whatsoever (as indeed it never

can), it moves to another station, and thus i‘sffialygaysfflin
