AUTHENTIGITY.—The original title of this letter, which was
written to the Counts Oberto and Guido, sons of Aghinolfo
da Romena, to condole with them on the death of their uncle
Alessandro, has not been preserved. The heading in the MS„
which assigns the letter to Dante, and gives the names o'f
the addressees, obviously did not form part of the original
composition. The information which it supplies (which is
independent of the letter itself) was no doubt derived by the

original compiler¹ of the collection from an earlier authority.

no longer extant. The attribution of the letter to Dante is
by no means universally accepted, chiefly on account of the
difficulty of reconciling the terms in which Alessandro is
spoken of in 13110 letter with the severe condemnation of him
by Dante in the Inferno (xxx. 76 ff.).² If Dante was the writer
of the letter, we must suppose that he did not become ac-
quainted with the facts referred to in the Commedia until some
time after Alessandro's death.3

DATEe-The date to be assigned to the letter must remain
conjecturaL as that of the death of Alessandro da Romena has
not been ascertained. There are plausible grounds, however,
for supposing Alessandro's death to have taken place in the
spring or summer of 1304, that is to say, between the date
of the previous 1ου1301·4 and that of the attempt of the exiles
on Florence from Lastra on July 20 of that year. In the
