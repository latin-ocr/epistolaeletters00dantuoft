ways of the Florentines—-‘Da’ lor costumi fa che tu ti
forbi'.¹

Borghini makes use of the letter in his Ioztroduzione al
Poema dv: Dante per Z'Alleyoria (first printed in 1855), in
which he quotes long extracts from the letter in the
original Latin, namely ἕξ 7 and 8, and parts of ἕξ 15 and
16, to show with what object Dante wrote the Commedia,
and the various senses in which he meant it to be inter-
preted 3 and part of ξ 32 for Dante's explanation why he
did not continue his exposition of the poem, his reason
being the ‘rei familiaris angustia ⁹. ² Borghini says that
the text of the letter as seen by him (which he evidently
emended in the passages he has quoted),was so corrupt as
to be hardly intelligible ;3 and after stating that it was at

that time known to many persons (‘in mano di molti ³),
’ he observes that by some of the old commentators on the

Commedia the letter was prefixed to their commentary as

υ the author’s own preface to his poem—an interesting

observation, which, however, is not confirmed by our
present knowledge of the early commentaries.⁴
Mazzoni’s mention of the letter occurs in the ,Introduffi

Ἰ tione c Sommario of the first volume of his celebrated Difesa

di Dante, which was published at Cesena in 1587. In his

4 This observation may possibly have been suggested to Borghini
by the Praefatio incerti AuctoriS, which accompanies the letter in some
of the MSS„ and was first printed by Baruffaldi in 1700 (see below,
