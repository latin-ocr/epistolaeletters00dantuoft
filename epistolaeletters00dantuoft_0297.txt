⁷ (comprising Epist. v, vi, vii, viii), and private and

personal (comprising Epist. ii, iii (iv), iv (iii), ix, x) ; in

the second would be included Epist. i, vii*‚ vii**, vii***.
For the purpose of applying the cursus test to the

Epistolae‚ a specimen may be selected of a representative

“ letter of each class. Taking the first section of the best

known of the political letterS‚ Epist. vii (to the Emperor
Henry VII), we have:

‘Immensa Dei dilectiene testante ( pl) ¹, relicta nobis est
pacis hereditas (t), ut in sua mira dulcedine (t) militiae
nostrae dlira mitescerent (t), et in usu eius patriae trium·
phantis (v) gaudia mereremur (v). At livor antiqui et
implacabilis hestis (101⁴), humanae prosperitati semper et
latenter insidians (t), nonnullos exheredando volentes (pl)
ob tuteris absentiam (t) nos alios impie denudavit in-
vitos (pl). Hinc diu super flumina confusienis defle·
vimus (t), et patrocinia iusti regis (v) incessanter implora-
bamus ( 123⁸), qui satellitium saevi tyranni disperderet (t),
et nos in nostra iustitia reformaret (v). Quumque tu,
Caesaris et Augusti successor (pl), Apennini itiga transi-
liens (t), veneranda signa Tarpeia retulisti (v), protinus
longa substiterunt suspiria (t), lacrymarumque diluvia

¹ It may be noted here that, strictly speaking, the clausula
only occurs where there is a pause, however slight3 but in
practice, with writers who observed the cursus, it became customary
to employ the formulae of the clausula even where there was no
pause. Numerous instances of this practice will be found through-
out the Epistulae of Dante. In this connexion Professor A. G. Clark
writes to me: ‘With regard to those rhythms which are not
accompanied by a pause—there was a tendency to extend the use
of “numeri '', and to employ them where there was no pause.
Also, in course of time, the harsher rhythms became obsolete‚ and
only the favourite “numeri ” were employed. The consequence
was that late metrical prose became a cento of those “numeri ''
from which the cursus developed.’
