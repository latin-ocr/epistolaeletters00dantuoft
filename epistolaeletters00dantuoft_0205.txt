EPISTOLA VIII 143

TRANSLATION

[To the Italian Cardinals Domte of Florem-e, dc]

§ 1. ‘How doth the city sit solitary that was full of
people! She is become as a widow that was great among
the nations.' The greed aforetime of the chiefs of the
Pharisees, which made the ancient priesthood an abomi-
nation, not only did away the ministry of the children of
Levi, but moreover brought siege and destruction on the
chosen city of David. And when He, who alone is eternal,
beheld this thing from his eternal watch-tower on high, by
his Holy Spirit He laid his command upon the mind
worthy of God of a man that was a prophet, and in the
words above written, alas! too often repeated, lamented
over holy Jerusalem as a city undone.

ξ 2. We too who confess the same Father and Son, the
same God and Man, yea, the same Mother and Virgin, we
for whose sake and for whose salvation thrice was the
question repeated concerning love and it was said: ‘ Peter,
feed my sheep ’, that is to say the sacred fold, Rome, to
which, after so many triumphs and glories, Christ by
word and deod confirmed the empire of the world, that
Rome which the same Peter, and Paul the preacher to the
Gentiles, by the sprinkling of their own blood consecrated
as the Apostolic See, over her, widowed and abandoned,
we, who come not after the woes we have to bewail, but

i now mourn in consequence of them, are, like Jeremiah,
const-rained to lament.

ξ 3. It grieves us, alas! no less to witness the lamen· <g
table plague of heresies, than that the fomenters of impiety,

χ Jews, Saracens, and Gentiles, make a mock of our Sab-
baths, and, as is said, cry out ‘Where is their God‘?'
and that perchance the renegade Powers ascribe this to
their own wiles against the protecting AngeIS. And,
more horrible still, certain readers of the stars and
ignorant prophete declare that to be of necessity, which
you, making ill use of your freedom of will, have preferred
of you own choice.
