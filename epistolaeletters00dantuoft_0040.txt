xxxiv LETTERS OF DANTE

iusto, et rectis corde laetitia,' ¹ than it was intimated to
me that Ι must either provide myself with an interpreter,
or speak in another language. Accordingly, whether
more in amazement or indignation I know not, I began

from the cradle; this, however, proved to be hardly more
familiar or native to them than the Latin had been.

Hence it has come about, that instead of being the
bearer to them of joy and gladness, I have been the

unbridled licentiousness.

though you may always command my services, not to
use me further on such like employmentS, from which, you
can look for no credit at any time, nor Ι for consolation.

the natural appetite of my bodily eyes for the wonders
and attractions of this place ; after which I shall transport
myself to that most welcome haven of my rest, under the
gracious protection of your royal courtesy.

(which was in fact at that time in Venice, as elsewhere in
Italy, the official language of the State) nor Italian, the
following blunders chronological and otherwise have been

pointed out amongst others as fatal to the protensions of
