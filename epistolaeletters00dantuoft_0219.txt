venitur, quae famae Dantisque ⁶ honori non deroget,

² MS„ O. victus ¹³ MS. autem3 O. aut ⁰ Ο. Dantis atque

¹ The MS. reading victus may not improbably, by the accidental
omission of the stroke over the i (representing n), be a copyist’s
error for vinctus, the sense of which (⁴1ike a prisoner in bonds') is
much more appropriate to the context than that of victus <which
would imply rather a prisoner of war); the point being that the
person who was presented at the oblatio, as a preliminary to being
pardoned, was either actually or technically a prisoner (see note on
oblatio, p. 154, n. 4).

2 This again, like absolvi in 1. 21, is 111010011111031ννοτᾱς cf. the
extract from the Provvisione of June 2, 1316, quoted in note on
oblatio: ‘Deo et beato Iohanni pro Comuni Florentie offerantur
et offerri possint et debeant' ; and that of Feb. 10, 1309, quoted by
Zenatti (op. cit„ p. 514): ‘Deo et Β. Iohanni pro Com. Florent.
offeratur et offerri possit et debeat ’.

⁸ The MS. reading is aut, with a stroke over it, which is the
normal abbreviation of autem3 but as autem cannot possibly be
the correct reading, the early editors one and all substituted aut.
As u and n are almost indistinguishable in MSS„ Della 'Porre
proposes to read ante, which is adopted in the text by Passerini
and Pistelli; but the recognized abbreviation of ante is αῖι (with
a stroke over the n), and it is so written in this MS. where the
word. occurs at the beginning of the letter (l. 11, ‘ ante iudicium ⁹).
On the other hand, it has been pointed out by Rostagno that ant
with a loop over the t is the regular abbreviation of antecedenter.
As this word suits the sense, and its adoption involves only a very
slight departure from the MS. reading, antecedenter seems preferable
to ante. One or other of these would appear to be required as the
correlative to the following deinde. (See Buu. Soc. Dant. Ital„ N.S.
xii. 125 11.)
