156 LETTERS OF DANTE

ᾧ 3. Estne ista revocatio gratiosa* 1, qua Dantes
Alagherii b revocatur ad patriam, per trilustrium fere ⁶20

festa quibuslibet? Hoc sudor et labor continuatus in
studio? Absit a viro philosophiae domestico temeraria
tantum ⁰3 cordis humilitaS, ut more cuiusdam Cioli 4 et

ἢ Ο. qloriosa ἶ) MS. allaqherii3 Ο. Aliqherius ⁰ Ο. terreni

1 The MS. reading yrosa can only stand for araliosa; not for
gloriosa (with Dionisi‚ δῖα, followed by 0.), which would be ylosa
in Ms.; nor for qenerosa (with Muzzi and Della Terre), which
would be ρηοεα. (See my note on Α misreadinq i‘n Dante’s Letter to
a Frie‘nd in Hormoe, in Bull. Soc. Dant. Ital„ Ns xx, pp. 58-9.)

² This reference approximately fixes the date of the letter,
Dante having been sentenced at the beginning of 1302 (see intro-
ductory note on date).

³ The MS. reading is in a sense indeterminate, as it may stand
for either tm, or tni, or tin. The last is out of the question here.
The second, in order to represent terreni (the reading of Dionisi‚ δια,
followed by 0.), should have a loop after the t, which, however,
might have been accidentally omitted by the scribe. The normal
solution of tm is tantum, which word seems to be required by the
construction as the correlative of the ut of l. 34. For tantum in the
sense of tam, see note on Epist. viii. 158.

⁴ This ‘Ciolus' has been identified with Giolo‘degli Abati, who
was condemned in 1291, and presented at the oblatio in or before
1295. This same Ciolo, alone of his-house, was expressly excepted
by name (‘ omnes de domo de Abbatibus, excepto Ciolo ') from the
decree of Sept. 2, 1311, known as the ‘Riforma di messer Baldo
d'Aguglione’‚ issued aga-inst the contumacious exiles, of whom
Dante was one. He is known to have been alive in July, 1313,
two years before the presumed date of this letter. His misdeeds
appear to have become proverbial in Florence. (See Della Terre,
iu Ball. Soc. Dant. Ital„ N .S. xii. 162-723 and Del Lungo, Dell' Esilio
di Dante, p. 137 ; and Dino Compaqni e la sua cronica, iii. 289, n. 24.)
