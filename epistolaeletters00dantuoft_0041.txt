INTRODUCTION xxxv ’

this letter to be considered authentic.1 To begin with,
all the available evidence goes to prove that *Dante did
not take refuge with Guido da Polenta at Ravenna till
1317 01· 1318, that is to say, not till three or four years
after the alleged date (1314) of this embassy to Venice.
Secondly‚ in the year 1314 Guido da Polenta was nov
Lord of Ravenna, as he is styled in the letter, but Podesta
of Cesena. Thirdly, the so-called ‘ recent election ⁹ of the

Doge (Gian Soranzo) had taken place more than a year
and a half before, vnamely, on July 13, 1312. Finally‚
we have the damning fact that Dante, who claims in the
Oommedia that he knew the Aeneid ‘tutta quanta ³,2 is
made to attribute to Virgil a quotation from Claudian, an
author with whom there is no evidence that he had any
acquaintance. To all of which may be added the further
objections that the letter is written in Italian, instead of in
³: Latin as we should naturally expect, and that it has a most
¹ decided ‘cinquecento’ ring about it, the style being as
· unlike Dante's known epistolary style as it could well be.
’ Doni included Dante's letter to the Emperor Hemy,
mwith other pieces from the Prose Antiche, in a subsequent
work, his Zacca, which he published at Venice in 1552;
but he did not reprint the letter to Guido‚ of which it
has not unnaturally beenassumed that he himself was
the fabricator. This letter, nevertheless‚ was accepted as
genuine by Biscioni, who reproduced it, ‚together with
that to the Emperor, in his Prose di Dante Aliyhieri e di
Messer Giovanm' Boccacoi, published at Florence in 1723 ;
and it has also found supporters in Tasso (in his Dialoyo
dez Formo, published in 1581) and Fontanini‚3 as well as
