§2 Tm: Cursus IN THE De Monarchia, De Vulyari
Eloquentia, AND Quaestio cle Aqua et Terra.

,Before proceeding to the examination of these works
from the point of view of the cursus, it must be explaIned
that we must not expect to find the cursus observed
systematically in the purely argumentative and didactic
portions of these treatises, in which of necessity technical
terms and expressions have to be introduced which do
not easily lend themselves to the required manipulation ;
its observance must only be looked for in the more
rhetorical and personal passages, Such passages naturally
occur in the introductory and concluding portions of the
works.2

Now on applying the cursus test to the first chapter
of the first book of the De ,Monarclcz‘a we observe the

1 Otherwise known as cursus octosyllabicus (see above, p. 229, n. 1).

² This will be found to be the case also in the letter to Can
Grande (Epist. x), the cursus being regularly observed in the
addi-ess and first four sections which constitute the epistolary
portions proper, but not in the remainder of the letter, which is
in the nature of a commentary, and full of technical terms and
quotations. Exceptions of a similar nature, it may be observed‚
covering titles, dates, quotations, and technical phraseology
generally, were formally recognized in the rules of the cursus of
the Roman Curia (see Valois‚ Etucle sur le Rythme des Bulles Pontifi-
cales, in Bibliolheque cle Z’Ecole des charles, xlii. 258 ; and Poole, 010· cit.‚

pp. 80, 94.
