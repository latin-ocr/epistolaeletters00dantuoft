PREFACE ix

numbering of the lines in the Oxford Dante, which is now

’ almost universally accepted as the ‘ standard ' numeration

for the purpose of reference.1 The numeration (of every
fifth line) on the hym-hand side of the page (to which
references in the Indices apply) is necessitated by the fact
that in not a few cases the introduction or excision of
matter in the course of the constitution of the present
text has thrown out the Oxford numbering of the lines.
The Battifolle letters, as not being included in the Ooeford
Dante, are numbered on the right-hand side only.

Ι had hoped to avail myself of the advice and assistance
,of my old friend and fellow Dantist, Dr. Edward Moore,
in the preparation of this edition, which was undertaken
in the first instance largely at his suggestion ; ‘² but this
” was not to be. Ι had, however, the satisfaction of re-
ceiving his approval of sundry of my proposed emendations
in the Oxford text, which I had submitted to him for his
consideration, shortly before his death.

In conclusion, Ι desire to express my acknowledgements
for valuable suggestions and genereus assistance to my
friend, Dr. C. B. Heberden, Principal of Brasenose, as

¹ It is, for example, the numeration adopted in my own Dante
Dictionaries, and (at Professor O. E. Norton’s instance, as the result
of an appeal from myself) in the American Dante Society’s con-
cordances to the Italian Prose Works and Latin Works of Dante
(printed at the Clarendon Press).

² In the last letter Ι received from him, just a week before he
died, Dr. Moore once more expressed the hope that I would em-

body the result of my labours on the text in a new edition of the
Epistolae.
