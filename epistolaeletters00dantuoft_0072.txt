10 LETTERS OF DANTE

civil right, should submit their necks to the yoke of
beneficent law, and should be brought by force to the
observance of their country’s peace! In sooth, the lawful
shaft of our purpose, leaping from the bowstring we held
stretched, sought solely the peace and liberty of the people
of Florence—sought, and ever will seek. But if your
vigilance is intent on a consummation so dear to us, and
you are resolved, as the end of your holy endeavours, that
our foes shall return to the furrows of good citizenship,
who shall attempt to render adequate thanks to you?
Not in our power is it, Ο Father, nor in that of any
of the Florentine race throughout the world. But if
there exists any goodness in heaven which looks upon
such deeds as worthy of recompense, may it grant meet
reward to you, who have clothed yourself with com·
passion for so great a city, and are hastening to compose
the unholy strife of her citizens! ’

§3. Whereas, then, by brother L„ a man of holy
religion, and an advocate of good citizenship and of
peace, we are urgently on your behalf admonished and
required (which was likewise the import of your letter)
to cease from all assault and act of war, and to commit
ourselves wholly to your fatherly hands, we as sons most
devoted to yourself, and as lovers >of peace and justice,
putting off our swords, of our own free will and without
reservation submit ourselves to your judgement, as by
the report of your messenger, the aforesaid brother L„
shall be made known to you, and by public instruments
in due form shall be declared abroad.

ξ 4. With filial voice, therefore, we most affectionately
implore that your most mercisul Holiness may bedew

i .- ι-υΜ

with the calm of tranquillity and peace this Florence .

so long tempest-tossed3 and that as a loving father you
may keep under your protection ourselves, who have

ever been the defenders of her people, and all who are ’

under our authority; for as we have never been remiss
in our love for our country, so we look never to stray
beyond the bounds of your behests, but always in duty
and devotion to be obedient to your commands, what-
soever they be.
