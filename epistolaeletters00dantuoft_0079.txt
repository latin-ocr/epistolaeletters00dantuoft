TRANSLATION

[This letter was written by Dante Aliyhiere? to the Counts
Oberto ancl Guido da Romena, after the death of their
wude, Coum Alessandro da Rmmma, to condole with them
οη his deceasa]

ξ 1. Your uncle, the illustrious Gount Alessandro, who
in these last days returned, after the spirit, to the heavenly
fatherland whence he came, was my Lord, and his memor-y
will have dominion over me so long as my life shall last
in this world; for his nobility of soul‚ which now is
richly recompensed with meet rewards beyond the stars,
for long years past, as he willed, made me his servant.
And verily this quality, accompanied as it was in him by
all the other virtues, caused his name to stand out, as it
were in bronze, above the fame of other Italians. And
what else did his heroic escutcheon proclaim‚ but- that
‘ we display the scourge that drives away vice’ ‘? for as

¹ 'serraca points out (Buzz. Soc. Dant. Ital„ NS. x, 131, n. 1) that
it was doubtless as the heirs of Alessandro that Dante addressed
his letter of condolence to Oberto and Guido, rather than to their
father Aghinolfb.
² For other references to the poverty brought upon Dante by his
exile, cf. Gonv. i. 3. ll. 19-373 Par. xvii. 58-603 Epist. x. 600-1.
