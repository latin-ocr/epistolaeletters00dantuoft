78 LETTERS OF DANTE

prescription‚ but must endure 80 long as time itself
endures‘? Verily the sacred precepts of the law declare,
and human reason after inquiry has decided‚ that public
control of 3113118, however long neglected‚ can never become
of 110 effect, nor be superseded, however much it be
weakened. For nothing which tends to the advantage of '
all can be destroyed, or even impaired, without injuiy 10
all——a thing contrary to the intention of God and nature,
and which would be utterly abhorrent to the opinion of·
all mankind. Wherefore, then, being disabused of such
an idle conceit, do you abandon the Holy Empire‚ and,

like the men of Babel once more, seek to found new ·

kingdoms, so 11131 111919 811311 be one polity of Florence,
and another of Rome ‘?. And why should not the Apostolic .
government 109 1119 object of 3 like envy, so that, if the one
twin of Delos have her double in the heavens, the other
should have his likewise1‘? But if reflection upon your
evil designs bring you no fears, at least let this strike
terror into your hardened hearts, that as the penalty for
your crime not only wistm, but the beginning of wisdomss
has been taken from you. For no condition of the sinner
is more terrible than that of him who, shamelessly and
without the fear of God, does whatsoever he lists. Full
often, indeed, the wicked man is smitten with this
punishment, that as during life he has been oblivious of
God, so when he dies he is rendered oblivious of himself.

ξ 3. But if your insolent arrogance has 80 deprived you
of the dew from on high, like the mountain-tops of Gilboa,
that you have not feared to resist the decree of the eternal
senate, and have felt no fear at not having feared, shall
that deadly fear, 10 wit human and worldly sear, not over-
whelm you, when the inevitable shipwreck of your proud
race, and the speedy end of your deeply to 109 rued law-
lessness, 811311 109 89911 10 be hard at hand? Do you put

1 ‘Delia’ and ‘Delius' (Diana and Apollo), that is, the Moon
and the Sun, typifying, as ‘the lesser and the greater light’, the
Empire and the Papacy (cf. Mon. iii. 4, 11. 10-21).

² ‘The sear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom’ (Psalm
cxi. 10).
