mind, depends entirely upon accent, not quantity, and in
which there is no elision, the hiatus being tolerated‚ three
principal types of clausula are recognized, which are known
respectively as pamm, tardus, and velow.

Cursus Planus.

The cursus planus in its normal form (pl) consists of
a paroxytone trisyllable (or its equivalent, a monosyllable
and a paroxytone dissyllable) preceded by a paroxytone
dissyllable or polysyllable, the caesura falling after the
second syllable of the clausula 3 as, esse Ι videtur ; vincla}
perfregit3 longum Ι sermonem3 dare Ι non vultis3 (obe)-
dire Ι mandatis.

As in the classical cursus two short syllables might be
substituted sor a long in the clausula‚1 so in the mediaeval
cursus it was allowable to substitute two unaccented
syllables for one in the same manner, a licence which
gave rise to what may be termed alternative or secondary
forms. Thus the normal form of the planus (esse videtur ;
longum sermonem) might be replaced by a secondary
form (113²), such as, esse Ι videatur3 dona Ι sentiamus3
(perve)n1're Ι mereamur3 the caesura falling after the
second syllable as in the normal form.2

Another variation of the normal planus was occasionally
admitted, without caesura, in which the whole clausula
was composed of a single word (pff) ; such as, indicabatur ;
transgredientes.³

Yet another form, which by some is classed as a variety
of planus (121⁴), and by others is placed in a separate
category styled cursus medius,⁴ consists of a paroxytone
dissyllable preceded by a proparoxytone trisyllable (or its
equivalent) or polysyllable, the caesura falling after the
