xvi LETTERS OF DANTE

These letters were written in Latin, in a lofty style, for·
tified with admirable precepts and authorities, and were
greatly commended by men of wisdom and discernment.¹

Of the three letters specifically mentioned by Vsslani,
two have been preserved3 namely, that to the Emperor
Henry (Epist. vii) and that to the Italian Gardinals
(Epist. viii). The third, that to the Florentino Govern-
ment, which is perhaps identical with one of those
mentioned by a subsequent authority, Leonardo Bruni,'²
has not come down to us. ’

Valuable evidence, direct and indirect, is supplied in
the next generation by Boccaccio, who, in his Vita dv:
Dante, written probably between 1357 and 1362‚³ says
that the poet ‘ wrote many prose epistles in Latin, of
which a number are still in existence' ; ⁴ and who cer-
tainly had first-hand knowledge of at least six of the
letters now extant. These are the letter to the Emperor
Henry VII (Epist. vii) and that to a friend in Florence
(Epist. ix), of which use is made in chapters five and
twelve of the Vita oh· Dcmte ;5 the letter to Can Grande
(Epist. x), which is largely utilized in the first and fifth

zand03 13 terza a‘ cardinali italiani, quand’ era la vacazione dopo
la morte di papa Clemente, acciocche s' accordassono a eleggere papa
