have compelled him to lift up his voice, and they should be
ashamed to receive rebuke from so humble a source ; but shame
may beget repentance, which in turn may give birth to purpose
of amendment. §10. With this view let them consider the
present unhappy condition of Rome, deprived as she is of both
her luminaries, which is their special concern as Cardinals of
the Roman Ghurch3 and let them reflect that it is they, and two
of them in particular, who have been responsible for her mis-
fortunes. §IL But there shall be amendment of the evil if
they one and all strive manfully on behalf of the Cim-oh, and
of Rome, and of Italy, so that the greed of the Gascons be
defeated, and they be made an example for all ageS.

‘¹ Presumably from punctus, in the sense of ‘at the point ’‚ ‘at
the summit'‚ hence ‘exalted’‚ ‘sublime’. I have not been able
to meet with another instance of the word. For the expression,
cf. Epist. vii. 136-7 ε ‘ de specula summae celsitudinis'.
