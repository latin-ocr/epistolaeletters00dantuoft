A revival took place in the eleventh century, when the
rhythmical cursus was adopted by the Roman Curia and
was the subject of elaborate rules.³ ‘The prose of this
period '‚ writes Professor Clark, ‘was largely epistolary ';
in which term are included ‘not merely private letterS,
but elaborate and courtly compositions sent to ecclesiasti-
cal dignitaries, and diplomatic documents proceeding from
the Papal Chancery. . . . The usual term for such composi-
tions was dictamen,⁴ writers were called dictatores,⁵ their
art was known as ars dictatoria, and handbooks giving
the rules were styled summa dictaminis? ⁶

The employment of the cursus soon spread beyond the
confines of the Papal Chancery, and became general, not

⁴ Dante applies this term to a poetical composition in the
De Vulgari Eloquentia (ii. 12, 1. 52).

⁵ Dante twice uses the word in this sense, viz, in the De Vulqari
Eloquentia (ii. 6, 1. 46), and in the letter to Can Grande (Epist. x,

⁷ This is brought out in an interesting way by Dante in the
sixth chapter of the second book of the De Vulqari Eloquentia, in
which 116 611 umerates four ‘degi-ees of construction ', with instances:
