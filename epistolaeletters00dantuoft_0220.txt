talem Florentia introitur, nunquam Florentiam introibo,
Quidni? nonne a solis astrorumque specula ubique con-
spiciam ? Nonne dulcissimas veritates potero speculari 35

populo FlorentinO, civitatib me reddam? Quippe nec

TRANSLArmN
[To a Friend in Florenca]

ξ 1. From your letter, which Ι received with due respect
and affection, and have diligently studied‚ Ι learn with
gratitude how my recall to Florence has been the object
of your care and concern; and I am the more beholden
to you therefor‚ inasmuch as it rarely happens that an
exile finds friends. My reply to what you have written,
although perchance it be not of such tenour as certain
faint hearts would desire, I earnestly beg may be carefully
examined and considered by you before judgement be
passed upon it.

ξ 2. Ι gather, then, from the letter of your nephew and
mine, as well as from those of sundry other friendS‚ that,
by the terms of a decree lately promulgated in Florence
touching the pardon of the exiles, I may receive pardon,
and be permitted to return forthwith‚ on condition that

pay a certain sum of money, and submit to the stigma

f the oblation—two propositions„ my Father, which in
ooth are as ridiculous as they are ill-advised—ill-advised‚
that is to say, on the part of those who have com-
municated them, for in your letter, which was more
discreetly and cautiously formulated, no hint of such
conditions was conveyed.v

ξ 3. This, then, is the gracious recall of Dante Alighieri

his native city, after the miseries of well-nigh fifteen
ears of exile! This is the reward of innocence manifest
