Ι received the favour of your royal letter with all
possible reverence, and studied 110 0011101110 with devotion.

Royal Highness supply what the humility of your cor—
respondent is not able to convey. But although the news
contained in your letter was unspeakably welcome and

present as in the futur,e without hesitation Ι commit
myself to the clemency of Augusta, and humbly make
early supplication that you may deign to place me in safe-
keeping beneath your Eminence's shadow, in such wise
that I may ever be, and may be seen to be, sheltered from
the fiery heat of all and every untoward chance.
