EPISTOLA ’ IX 153

concluded that the addressee was a priest. These consideratione
have led to the conj ectural identification of the addressee with
a brother-in-law of Dante, namely Teruccio di Manetto Donati,l
a brother of Gemma, Dante's wife, who was a member of
‚a religious order and a bachelor of divinity. Their common
nephew in that case would be Niccolo Donati, son of Foresino
(or Forese) di Manetto Donati, another brother of Gremma’s.2

sommam-‚t 1. Dante acknowledges receipt of his corre-
spondent's letter, and expresses his gratitude for the interest
he has shown in his recall from exile; and he begs tha-t his
reply may not be hastily judged. §Z He understands from
letters received from a common nephew and from other friends
that he will be allowed to return to Florenoe on certain
degrading conditions. §3. Is this then the gracious recall
that he, an innocent man, was to look for after all these years
of exile ἰ) Far be it from him to accept such terms ! §4. If he
may return to Florence on honourable conditions, well and
good—if not, then he will never return. Assuredly he will find
means to pursue his studies and win his bread elsewhere, with·
out being obliged to render himself an object of contempt in
the eyes of his fellow·citizens !
