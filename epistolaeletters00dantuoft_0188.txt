126 LETTERS OF DANTE

Jacques d'Euse of Gahors‚ Archbishop of Avignon, who was
elected Pope at Lyons on Aug. 7, 1316, 01111 took the title of
John XXII. It is impossible to fix precisely the date of Dante’s
letter to the Italian Gardinals; but from his reference (in
11. 182-3) 10 ‘the contest that is already begun', it appears
probable that it was written soon after the death of CIement, in
the early days of the Conclave, that is 111 May 01 June, 1314, and
at any rate before the irruption of the Gascons into the Con-
clave which reduced the Italian Cardinals to impotence.

SUMMARY.—§ 1. As the corruption 01 13110 priesthood of old
brought ruin on Jerusalem, whose fate was lamented by
J eremiah ; ξ 2. so now Rome, which by the blood of Peter and
Paul was consecrated as 13110 Apostolic See, suffers in like
manner, and like her is left desolate. §3. Jews and Gentiles
make a mock 01 her, and the powers 01 evil prevail, which
things astrologers and false prophets declare 130 be of necessity,
whereas they arise from the abuse of free will. §4. The Cardi-
nals, the special guardians Rof the Ghuroh, have gone astray
from the track‚ and have brought themselves and their charge
to the verge of destruction. Let them take warning by the fate
of Nadab and Abihu, and of them that sold doves in the temple,
and repent them of their transgressions ere it be too late. ξ 5. If
the writer be charged with the presumption of Uzzah, he will
reply that Uzzah laid his hand on the Ark, whereas he gives hecd
to the unruly oxen that are dragging it into the wilderness.
ξ 6. If shame be not dead, they should blush at the thought that
his voice alone, and that of a private individual‚ should be
raised in lamentation over the demise of the Church. §7. But
little wonder, for one and. all are devoted to covetousness, the
'Fathers of the Church are neglected for the Decretalists, and
publicus pateret egressus, tandem posteriorem murum palatii,
facto inibi parvo foramine, pro nostra salute rupimus, de Gar-
pentorate postmodum dispersi discedentes, non sine mortis peri-
culo ad diversa loca discessimus, et per misericordiam Dei, quae
est illa quae nos salvos reddidit, ad terras pervenimus amicorum. . . .
