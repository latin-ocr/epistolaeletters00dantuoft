that date had come into the possession of the Florentine
scholar and biographer of Dante, Giannozzo Manetti

69), has left an interesting account of this transaction (see
Ourzio Mazzi, Leone Allacci e la Palatina di Heidelbery, Bologna, 1893).
Some idea of the extent of the collection may be gathered. from the
fact that Allacci estimated that the covers alone, which to facilitate
’ transport he caused to be stripped from the MSS„ amounted to
thirteen wagon—loads: ‘Lo sgravamento delle coperte,' he writes,
