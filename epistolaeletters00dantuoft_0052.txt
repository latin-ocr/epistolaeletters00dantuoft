xlvi LETTERS OF DANTE

3. The Latin text of the letter to the Emperor Henry ·
VII (Epist. vii), now printed for the first time from
a MS. in the Biblioteca Marciana at Venice. Witte's
attention having been drawn to the fact that extracts
from this letter in Latin were printed in the catalogue of
the Biblioteca Muranese4 search was made at his instance
through the good, offices of the Marchese Gian Giacomo
Trivulzio, with the result that the MS. containing the
letter was discovered by the Abate Giovanni Antonio
Moschini‚ the Prefetto of the Biblioteca Marciana,
whither the spoils of the Murano Library had been
transferred. Besides the Latin text, Witte included an
emended text of the Italian translation of the same letter,
which had been first printed by Doni in 1547.

4. The Latin text of the letter to the Italian Cardinals
(Epist. viii), now first printed in full from the Laurentian
MS. The first few paragraphs of this letter were, as we ’
have seen, printed by Troya in his Veltro Alleyorico in
1826. Τ119 remainder was copied and printed by Witte
himself in the same year in the Antoloyia of Florence;¹
and he ‚now printed a revised and emended text of the

whole letter.
5. The Latin text (revised) of the letter to a Florentine

friend (Epist. ix), first printed by Dionisi at Verona in
1790.

6. Τ119 Latin text (with numerous emendations) of the .
letter to Can Grande (Epist. x). first printed in full by
Baruffaldi at Venice in 1700.

7. The apocryphal letter, as Witte does not hesitate to
pronounce it‚2 to Guido da Polenta, first printed by Doni
in 1547. '
