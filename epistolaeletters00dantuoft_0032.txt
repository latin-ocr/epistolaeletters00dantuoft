xxvi LETTERS OF DANTE

in possession of a Ms. which contained no less than nine
letters written by, or attributed to, Dante, this MS.
being the now famous Vatican MS. (0002. Vota-Palati. Lat.
1729), of which we shall have more to say later.¹

The next piece of evidence is supplied, not by a bio-
grapher of Dante, but by a fifteenth-century historiam,
namely Flavio Biondo of Forh, who in his Historiarum
ab inclinato Romam Imperio DecadeS, which was com-
pleted in or about the year 1440, states that he had seen
at Forh letters written by Pellegrino Calvi, secretary of
Scarpetta degli Ordelaffi, the Ghibelline leader in Forh,
which had been dictated by Dante, and in which Dante’s
name frequently occurs—‘ Peregrini Calvi foroliviensis,
Scarpettae epistolarum magistri, 'extantes literae, crebram
Dantis mentionem habentes, a quo dictabantur’ ;‘·' and
in another passage he makes special mention of a letter
written by Dante in his own name and in that of the
exiled Bianchi to Can Grande della Scala at the time of
the advent of the Emperor Henry VII into Italy, in
which Dante gave an account of the insolent reply re-
turned by the Florentines to the ambassadors of the
Emperor—a letter of which, as Biondo tells us, a copy
was taken by Pellegrino Calvi—‘Dantes Aldegerius,
Forolivii tunc agens, in epistola ad Canem Grandem Sca-
ligerum veronensem, partis Albae extorrum et suo
nomine data, quam Peregrinus Calvus scriptam reliquit,
talia dicit de responsione a· Florentinis urbem tenentibus
tunc facta '.³

Of these letters, which must be assigned to the period
of Dante’s presumed residence at Forh in 1303 and 1310,
